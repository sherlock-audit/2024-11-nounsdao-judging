# Missing check of between miminumTickDuration ,streamLengthInTicks and duration of auction

### Summary

If streamLengthInTick is too large then the total time(miminumTickDuration * streamLengthTicks) is larger than duration of auction. The stream is not worked as expected.

There is no check of streamLengthInTicks * minimumTickDuration and duration of the auction. If the streamLengthInTicks is large than duration/minimumTickDuration, the total time of stream is larger than duration of auction. It's not expected.
