# Many view functions will be unusable after 3-4 years because of block gas limit

### Summary

In the getSettlements function, the array declared will have the length as the auctionCount parameter. So as the number of auctions increase, this value has to increase to see the results of the first auction. After 3-4 years this function will be unusable since it will hit the block gas limit of 30Million.

### Root Cause

The loop and the array are the main reasons why the function will hit the gas limit and be unusable after around 1000 days (~30k gas per iteration). 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Approximately 3-4 years must pass.

### Attack Path

Calling the getSettlements function itself will revert due to gas limits.

### Impact

A user will never be able to see the old auction winners or prices. This can affect the frontend performance of the protocol too.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Keep a function to view the settlements of a particular auction, without the use of loops.
