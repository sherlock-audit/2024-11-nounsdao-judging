# Stream duration can be modified, but the docs said it should not be possible for legal purpose

### Summary

Per the [docs of the protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gxLSkRQooJtcqMm3I86cOJpsnaObwEE5ergqkSl87kM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gyd74m96vtqo) from the Readme and announcement on [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/verbsteam.eth/jFi5T0aehwZws7Q6jdRn8xZmORu25TiyWz4G5LAHuaU), a stream should always equal to approximately 4 years, and this value is an invariant that cannot be modified. But it's possible to change it by calling `NounsAuctionHouseV3::setStreamLengthInTicks()`

> Escrow parameters
> - Upgradeable and under DUNA control: No.
> - Stream duration:
>    - Value: 4 years.
>    - Can it be modified: No.

### Root Cause

The function [`setStreamLengthInTicks`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L287-L291) should not exist 

```solidity
    function setStreamLengthInTicks(uint16 _streamLengthInTicks) public onlyOwner {
        require(_streamLengthInTicks > 0, 'streamLengthInTicks too low');
        streamLengthInTicks = _streamLengthInTicks;
        emit StreamLengthInTicksUpdated(_streamLengthInTicks);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Deploy `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol`

### Attack Path

1. Owner call `setStreamLengthInTick()` and change the stream duration of the Escrow.

### External pre-conditions

1. A user buys a noun, and an auction is settled. `settleAuction()` will create a new stream with a duration that is the new value set by the owner and will differ from 4 years.

### Impact

It breaks the invariant assumption that duration cannot be modified and all streams will be equal to 4 years, as stated in the docs provided in the `README` and what has been communicated to the user.
Loss of trust from users to the protocol.
Legal issues regarding the DAO organization as this update is due to comply with the regulation.

### Mitigation

Delete the function `setStreamLengthInTicks()` as it should not be possible to modify the value
