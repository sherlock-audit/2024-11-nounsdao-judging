# Malicious `nouns.mint()` Revert will Pause Auction House

### Summary

In [`NounsAuctionHouseV3::_createAuction()`](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/verbs-stream-escrow-nouner-can-create-stream/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L300-L317), the `nouns.mint()` function is wrapped in a `try...catch` block. A malicious actor can cause the `nouns.mint()` to revert by calling `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` with a pre-calculated gas amount. Despite the revert in `nouns.mint()`, the transaction completes, triggering the `_pause()` function and causing the auction house to pause unexpectedly.


### Root Cause

The `try...catch` block in [`NounsAuctionHouseV3::_createAuction()`](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/verbs-stream-escrow-nouner-can-create-stream/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L300-L317) pauses the auction house if `nouns.mint()` fails, while the required gas for  `nouns.mint()` and `_pause()` is different.
