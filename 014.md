# Incorrect Initialization will make `OnlyOwner` functions inaccessible ,owner will not receive funds meant for him  and the contracts will remain in a paused state.

### Summary


When initializing the OwnableUpgradeable library from openzeppelin, you normally use the __Ownable_init(_owner); , with your owner address, this will successfully set the right address for the contract.

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol#L51C1-L53C6

```solidity
    function __Ownable_init(address initialOwner) internal onlyInitializing {
        __Ownable_init_unchained(initialOwner);
    }
```

However this does not happen, as the both AuctionsHOuse contracts `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol`  have the initializer  set `__Ownable_init();` instead of `__Ownable_init(_owner);`


NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol

```solidity
     * @notice Initialize the auction house and base contracts,
     * populate configuration values, and pause the contract.
     * @dev This function can only be called once.
     */
    function initialize(
        uint192 _reservePrice,
        uint56 _timeBuffer,
        uint8 _minBidIncrementPercentage
    ) external initializer {
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
->        __Ownable_init();

        _pause();

        reservePrice = _reservePrice;
        timeBuffer = _timeBuffer;
        minBidIncrementPercentage = _minBidIncrementPercentage;

```

NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol

```solidity
  /**
     * @notice Initialize the auction house and base contracts,
     * populate configuration values, and pause the contract.
     * @dev This function can only be called once.
     */
    function initialize(
        uint192 _reservePrice,
        uint56 _timeBuffer,
        uint8 _minBidIncrementPercentage,
        uint16 _immediateTreasuryBPs,
        uint16 _streamLengthInTicks,
        address _streamEscrow
    ) external initializer {
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
->        __Ownable_init();

        _pause();

        reservePrice = _reservePrice;
        timeBuffer = _timeBuffer;
        minBidIncrementPercentage = _minBidIncrementPercentage;
        immediateTreasuryBPs = _immediateTreasuryBPs;
        streamLengthInTicks = _streamLengthInTicks;
        streamEscrow = IStreamEscrow(_streamEscrow);
    }
```
Both contracts also call the pause function in the initializer, which would mean that the paused state of the contract could not be reversed back.

When an aunction gets settled he owner is meant to receive ETH/WETH from `_settleAuction` inside `NounsAuctionsHouseV2.sol` and ``NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol` which will not send to the owner as the owner is never set!

```solidity

        if (amountToSendTreasury > 0) {
            _safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), amountToSendTreasury);
        }
       
```        
```solidity
        
        if (_auction.amount > 0) {
            _safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), _auction.amount);
        }

### Root Cause

In both both`NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol` the `ownable_init()` is missing the owner's address inside the initializer function  `__ownable_init(owner)` .

If you do not provide the address this will cause the owner never to be set for the `OwnableUpgradeable.sol`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- All the onlyOwner cannot be called by the owner as the owner is never set.
- The contract will remain in a paused state ,as in the initializer `_pause` is called and there is no owner to unpause it.
- Owner will never receive the funds meant for the Owner.
