# Stream duration extension due to uncapped duration of tick forwarding

### Summary

The reliance on manual forwardAll calls in StreamEscrow will cause significant timeline extension for streams as delayed forwardAll calls can extend a 4 year stream to more than 4 years, breaking core timing assumptions of the protocol.


### Root Cause

There is no implementation in the code limiting the tick duration, or automatically trigger `forwardAll` after `minimumTickDuration` passes.
The choice to not implement a maximum time between ticks is a mistake as it allows `forwardAll` delays to compound, significantly extending stream durations beyond their intended timelines.
```solidity
function forwardAll() public {
        // silently fail if at least a day hasn't passed. this is in order not to revert auction house.
        if (block.timestamp < lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration) {
            return;
        }

        lastForwardTimestamp = toUint48(block.timestamp);

        sendETHToTreasury(ethStreamedPerTick);

        (uint32 newTick, uint128 ethPerTickEnded) = increaseTicksAndFinishStreams();

        emit StreamsForwarded(newTick, ethPerTickEnded, ethStreamedPerTick, lastForwardTimestamp);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A stream needs to exist and be active
2. forwardAll calls are delayed beyond minimumTickDuration

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Stream is created with 1460 ticks (intended 4 year duration)
2. Assume each forwardAll call is delayed by 1 hour beyond minimumTickDuration. This delay can be more than 1 hour
3. This compounds across all ticks:

Total delay = 1460 ticks * 1 hour delay
                   = 1460 hours
                   = 60 days
                   â‰ˆ 2 months additional duration

### Impact

- The protocol's core timing assumptions are broken
- Streams intended to last 4 year will take 4 years and 2 months to complete
- Treasury receives payments over a longer period than intended

### Mitigation

In the contract, implement a logic that automatically trigger `forwardAll` after `minimumTickDuration` passes.
