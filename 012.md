# No limit on NounsAuctionV3 auction extension period could drag auctions on for very long periods

## Summary
No limit on auction extension periods for V3 auctions could cause indefinite or very dragged on auction periods depending on configured `minBidIncrementPercentage` and `reservePrice`.

## Vulnerability Details
During an auction, users bid calling [createBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L145-L182), while a limit on the placed bid amount is enforced with:

```solidity
        require(msg.value >= _reservePrice, 'Must send at least reservePrice');
        require(
            msg.value >= _auction.amount + ((_auction.amount * _minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
            'Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount'
        );
```

If the `reservePrice` and `minBidIncrementPercentage` is not high enough a user only needs to bid `minBidIncrementPercentage` more for this to pass. As long as the executed bid is placed within the `timeBuffer` which is set to a max upper limit of 1 day, there is no limit enforced on how many times the auction end could be shifted:

```solidity
        bool extended = _auction.endTime - block.timestamp < _timeBuffer;
        ...
        if (extended) {
            auctionStorage.endTime = _auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + _timeBuffer);
            emit AuctionExtended(_auction.nounId, _auction.endTime);
        }
```

## Impact
Auctions have no definite limit on when they would end using time extensions, and depending on the auction amount - if small enough, auctions can be dragged out indefinitely.

## Resolution
This can be resolved using the following tactics together:

1. Place a limit on how many times an auction can be time extended.
2. Enforce a high enough value for `reservePrice` and `minBidIncrementPercentage` so that tiny amounts cannot be used to postpone auctions.
3. Use a shorter `timeBuffer` period.
