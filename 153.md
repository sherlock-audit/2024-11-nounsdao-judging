# Stream Owner Can Receive Excess Tokens by Omitting forwardAll() Before Calling `cancelStream()`

### Summary

The forwardAll() function must be executed prior to cancelStream() to ensure accurate refund calculations. However, the current implementation does not enforce this sequence, allowing cancelStream() to be called while currentTick remains outdated if forwardAll() has not been invoked. This discrepancy results in incorrect refund amounts, with users potentially receiving higher refunds than intended.



### Root Cause

The cancelStream() function is responsible for calculating the remaining stream amount and issuing a refund to the user. This refund calculation is based on currentTick, which is updated by the forwardAll() function. However, since forwardAll() is typically triggered by the Auction House during auction settlement (and there is no incentive for other users to call it), the currentTick can often remain stale. As a result, refunds calculated within cancelStream() may be based on outdated data.

```solidity
function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
    require(isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream not active');

    // transfer noun to treasury
    nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);

    // cancel stream
    streams[nounId].canceled = true;
    Stream memory stream = streams[nounId];
    ethStreamedPerTick -= stream.ethPerTick;
    ethStreamEndingAtTick[stream.lastTick] -= stream.ethPerTick;

    // calculate how much needs to be refunded
    uint256 ticksLeft = stream.lastTick - currentTick;
    uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;
    (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amountToRefund }('');
    require(sent, 'failed to send eth');

    emit StreamCanceled(nounId, amountToRefund, ethStreamedPerTick);
}
```

This function calculates the unstreamed amount based on the ticks left and refunds the owner by transferring the Noun NFT to the treasury.  

```solidity
    // calculate how much needs to be refunded
    uint256 ticksLeft = stream.lastTick - currentTick;
    uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;
    (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amountToRefund }('');
    require(sent, 'failed to send eth');
```

From the above snippet, we can see that the calculation of `amountToRefund` is based on `currentTick`.  

Now, let’s examine `forwardAll()`:  

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao-SteveHarrington0/blob/fb464dcfa1c70b786cc6294f49a5bad84a233854/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L136

```solidity
    if (block.timestamp < lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration) {
        return;
    }
```

The `currentTick` is updated only when 24 hours (the `minimumTickDuration`) have passed since the `lastForwardTimestamp`. The `forwardAll()` function is expected to be called by the Auction House contract through `forwardAllAndCreateStream()` when settling an auction.  

Since auctions in the Auction House generally take longer than 24 hours, and there is no incentive for other users to call `forwardAll()`, the `currentTick` often remains outdated. Consequently, if a user cancels their stream, the refund amount is calculated based on the stale `currentTick`, leading to an inaccurate refund.  


### Internal pre-conditions

1. block.timestamp > lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration.
2. No user has called forwardAll().

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An auction is created and settled after successful bids. A portion of the bid amount is transferred to the treasury, while the remainder is deposited into the StreamEscrow contract.
2. For every tick, a fixed amount (ethStreamedPerTick) is sent from the escrow to the treasury.
3. If the stream owner calls cancelStream() without first calling forwardAll():
    - No tokens are forwarded to the treasury for the current tick.
    - The stream owner cancels the stream prematurely and withdraws more tokens than they are entitled to.
    - The treasury suffers a loss equal to the skipped tick's allocation. 

### Impact

The impact of this issue is that users receive a higher refund than they should, which creates an unfair situation among users.  

For instance, imagine there are two users:  
- The first user cancels their stream **before** `forwardAll()` is called.  
- The second user cancels their stream **after** `forwardAll()` is called.  

In this scenario, the first user would receive a higher refund because their refund calculation is based on an outdated `currentTick`, whereas the second user’s refund is calculated using the updated `currentTick`.  

This inconsistency highlights the lack of a guarantee that `forwardAll()` will be called before a stream is canceled. To address this issue, `forwardAll()` should be invoked within the `cancelStream()` function to ensure fairness and accurate refund calculations for all users.

### Mitigation

```solidity
function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
        
 @>>       forwardAll();  // Add this function
                // Remaining logic for cancelStream
}
```
