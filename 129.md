# Incorrect Auction House Address in StreamEscrow Deployment

### Summary

Incorrectly initializing `streamCreator_` with `AuctionHouseproxy` instead of `AuctionHouseV3` will lead to a total failure in stream creation for DAO auctions, as the `StreamEscrow` contract will fail to recognize valid auction completions from the new V3 auction house.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/script/StreamEscrow/DeployAuctionHouseV3StreamEscrowBase.s.sol#L31C1-L39C1

### Root Cause

In `DeployAuctionHouseV3StreamEscrowBase.s.sol`, the StreamEscrow constructor is initialized with auctionHouseProxy (V2) instead of the newly deployed auctionHouseV3 for the streamCreator_ parameter

in this  https://etherscan.io/address/0x830BD73E4184ceF73443C15111a1DF14e495C706#code
you can check that this `0x830BD73E4184ceF73443C15111a1DF14e495C706` is not the auctionHouse but the proxy

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The deployment script is executed, creating both AuctionHouseV3 and StreamEscrow contracts
2. StreamEscrow is initialized with the wrong auction house address (V2 instead of V3)
3. When AuctionHouseV3 attempts to create a stream after an auction:
  - The StreamEscrow contract will reject the stream creation
  - This is because the msg.sender (AuctionHouseV3) doesn't match the authorized streamCreator_ (AuctionHouseV2)

### Impact

The DAO auction system becomes non-functional as streams cannot be created after auctions complete. This effectively breaks the core functionality of the V3 auction system and requires redeployment of the contracts.

### Mitigation

```solidity
streamEscrow = new StreamEscrow({
    daoExecutor_: timelock,
    ethRecipient_: timelock,
    nounsRecipient_: timelock,
    nounsToken_: nounsToken,
  ++  streamCreator_: address(auctionHouseV3),  // Fixed: Use V3 instead of V2
    minimumTickDuration_: minimumTickDuration
});
```
