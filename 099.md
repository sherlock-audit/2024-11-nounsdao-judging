# Malicious Users Can Hijack Contract Upgrades

### Summary

The lack of proper access control and the window for front-running during the contract upgrade process creates a vulnerability for the auction house as malicious actors will exploit the window between contract deployment and upgrade.


### Root Cause

In `DeployAuctionHouseV3StreamEscrowMainnet.s.sol`, the `initialize` function is not called after deploying the `StreamEscrow` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3` contracts. This oversight creates a vulnerability where the contract can be hijacked.

```solidity
// Example of missing initialize call
function run() public returns (StreamEscrow streamEscrow, NounsAuctionHouseV3 auctionHouseV3) {
    (streamEscrow, auctionHouseV3) = super.runInternal({
        dao: INounsDAOLogic(DAO_PROXY_MAINNET),
        auctionHouseProxy: INounsAuctionHouseV2(AUCTION_HOUSE_MAINNET),
        minimumTickDuration: 24 hours
    });

    // Missing call to initialize
    // auctionHouseV3.initialize(...);
}
```

### Attack Path


1. A malicious user observes the deployment of the `StreamEscrow` contract.
2. The malicious user front-runs the upgrade transaction, to call the `initialize` function in `NounsAuctionHouseV3` before the legitimate upgrade proposal is processed.
3. The actor calls a function in the `StreamEscrow` contract that allows them to manipulate its state or hijack control.


**Documentation Reference**: According to the project documentation, the upgrade proposal transaction would include:
auctionHouseProxyAdmin.upgrade(auctionHouseProxyAddress, newAuctionHouseLogicAddress);
auctionHouseProxy.setStreamEscrowParams(immediateTreasuryBPs, streamLengthInTicks, streamEscrowContractAddress);


However, according to the docs, this upgrading transaction is distinct from the deployment of the two contracts, which is done using the script `DeployAuctionHouseV3StreamEscrowMainnet`, which is still in scope for the audit: [Github Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/script/StreamEscrow/DeployAuctionHouseV3StreamEscrowBase.s.sol#L26-L38)

### Impact


The auction house suffers a complete loss of control over its escrow functionality. The attacker gains ownership of the auction house contract, allowing them to:
- Change critical parameters such as the reserve price, time buffer, and minimum bid increment percentage, which directly affects auction mechanics.
- Redirect funds intended for the treasury or escrow to their own address, resulting in financial losses for the protocol and its users.
