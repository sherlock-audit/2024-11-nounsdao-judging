# Only noun owner should be able to call cancelStream function in streamEscrow.

### Summary

The cancelStream function in streamEscrow is public and anyone can call it which might cause anyone calling it to transfer the noun token to himself.  

### Root Cause

It is important to note that the _checkAuthorized function is not part of the standard ERC-721 implementation defined by the Ethereum standard (EIP-721). Instead, it is a utility or helper function often implemented by developers to centralize authorization checks in custom ERC-721 implementations. Whether you include it is entirely optional and depends on your specific requirements for the contract. In the above scenario if _checkAuthorized is not implemented in the nounsToken contract anyone will be able to call cancelStream.
