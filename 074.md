# `TicksToForward` can be arbitrarily large in `fastForwardStream:StreamEscrow.sol` (within limits) that allow attacker to submit arbitrarily large values

### Summary

The `fastForwardStream` function in the smart contract allows the fast-forwarding of a stream of ETH. Although there is a limit to how many ticks the stream can be advanced (based on the difference between currentTick and stream.lastTick), the function does not impose a maximum limit on the `ticksToForward` value within the allowed range. This opens the door for users to exploit the function by submitting arbitrarily large values of `ticksToForward` (within the allowed range), manipulating the contract's internal state, draining ETH from the contract, or causing other unintended behavior.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability arises in the following part of the `fastForwardStream` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L206
```solidity
require(ticksToForward <= stream.lastTick - currentTick_, 'ticksToForward too large');
```
This line only ensures that `ticksToForward` does not exceed the difference between the current tick and the stream's last tick. However, there is no further restriction on how large `ticksToForward` can be within that range. An attacker could still submit a large, but valid, value of `ticksToForward`, potentially causing the contract to perform excessive state updates, drain ETH from the contract, or cause performance degradation due to the large number of state changes.

### Internal pre-conditions

Stream associated with nounId = 1.
`currentTick` = 100.
`lastTick` = 1000.
`ethPerTick` = 10.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Attacker invokes `fastForwardStream(1, 900)`.
`ticksToForward` value is valid, so it gets accepted by the contract.
The contract moves `lastTick` from 1000 to 100 (lastTick - ticksToForward = 1000 - 900 = 100).
ETH (900 * 10 = 9000) is sent to the treasury.

Code example:
```solidity
require(ticksToForward <= stream.lastTick - currentTick_, 'ticksToForward too large'); // Passes as 900 <= 900
uint32 newLastTick = stream.lastTick - ticksToForward; // newLastTick = 1000 - 900 = 100
ethStreamEndingAtTick[stream.lastTick] -= stream.ethPerTick; // Decreases ETH at tick 1000
streams[nounId].lastTick = newLastTick; // Updates lastTick to 100
ethStreamEndingAtTick[newLastTick] += stream.ethPerTick; // Increases ETH at tick 100
uint256 ethToStream = ticksToForward * stream.ethPerTick; // ethToStream = 900 * 10 = 9000
sendETHToTreasury(ethToStream); // Sends 9000 ETH to treasury
```

### Impact

An attacker can repeatedly invoke the fastForwardStream function with large but valid values of ticksToForward, draining ETH from the contract.

The attacker successfully invokes the `fastForwardStream` function with `ticksToForward` = 900, which is within the valid range (since 1000 - 100 = 900).
ETH amount of 9000 (calculated as 900 * 10) is transferred to the treasury.
The contractâ€™s internal state is updated with the new `lastTick` = 100, reflecting the fast-forwarded stream.

### Mitigation

Add a cap for how many ticks a stream can be fast-forwarded at once to prevent an attacker from submitting excessively large values.
```solidity
uint32 constant MAX_TICKS = 500; // Example cap to limit fast forwarding to a reasonable value
require(ticksToForward <= MAX_TICKS, "ticksToForward exceeds cap");
```
