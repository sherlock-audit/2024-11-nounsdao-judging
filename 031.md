# In a specific case, owner of the noun would receive incorrect amountToRefund and this can forward to occur DOS more importantly

### Summary

The contract `streamEscrow` has a potential DOS vulnerability. It's possible for owner and operator of noun to create stream with the same `nounId` at the same time. If this archived, owner of the noun would receive incorrect amountToRefund when he canceled the stream. And, about `streamEscrow`, it'll get into Denial of Service after the moment that the `lastTick `of the `nounId `below the `currentTick`.

### Root Cause

The following snippet includes `isApprovedOrOwner`.
[StreamEscrow.sol::L112-L130](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L112C5-L130C6)

```solidity
function createStream(uint256 nounId, uint16 streamLengthInTicks) public payable {
        require(allowedToCreateStream[msg.sender], 'not allowed');
        require(isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, nounId), 'only noun owner or approved');
        require(!isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream active');

        // register new stream
        uint128 ethPerTick = toUint128(msg.value / streamLengthInTicks);
        uint32 streamLastTick = currentTick + streamLengthInTicks;
        ethStreamEndingAtTick[streamLastTick] += ethPerTick;

        // the remainder is immediately streamed to the DAO
        uint256 remainder = msg.value % streamLengthInTicks;
        sendETHToTreasury(remainder);

        uint128 newEthStreamedPerTick = ethStreamedPerTick + ethPerTick;
        ethStreamedPerTick = newEthStreamedPerTick;
        streams[nounId] = Stream({ ethPerTick: ethPerTick, canceled: false, lastTick: streamLastTick });
        emit StreamCreated(nounId, msg.value, streamLengthInTicks, ethPerTick, newEthStreamedPerTick, streamLastTick);
}
```
Of course the Owner of the nounId can call this `createStream()` function and the approved operator of the nounId also can call this function because of `isApprovedorOwner()`.
[StreamEscrow.sol::L319-L325](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L319C5-L325C6)

```solidity
function isApprovedOrOwner(address caller, uint256 nounId) internal view returns (bool) {
        address owner = nounsToken.ownerOf(nounId);
        if (owner == caller) return true;
        if (nounsToken.isApprovedForAll(owner, caller)) return true;
        if (nounsToken.getApproved(nounId) == caller) return true;
        return false;
}
```
Now, consider of the specific case. Both of the owner and operator of the same `nounId `participated the `NounsAuctionHouse` and received nouns individually. When they received nouns, `NounsAuctionHouse` created streams automatically. Then these two guys didn't cancel their streams. The most important point is up now. These guys can be allowed to create stream because they are all owners of nouns that received from `NounsAuctionHouse`. But focus on assumption that one of them was the operator of other's noun. If the admin allows these guys to create streams, the trouble has been started.

As we can see, in `createStream()`, verifications are before the main processing of the function. So when guys mentioned above execute this function at the same time, this will occurs complex problem. First, double values of `ethPerTick` is added to `ethStreamedPerTick`. Then, `streams[nounId]` can get the operator's value.

If the owner of that `nounId` cancel the stream, he will get `amountToRefund` calculated by operator's stream. Moreover, after the cancel of the stream, `ethStreamedPerTick` is reduced by `stream.ethPerTick` just once. It means the other part of `ethPerTick` is still remind in `ethStreamedPerTick`.
[StreamEscrow.sol::L167-L186](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L167C5-L186C6)

```solidity
function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
        require(isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream not active');

        // transfer noun to treasury
        nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);

        // cancel stream
        streams[nounId].canceled = true;
        Stream memory stream = streams[nounId];
        ethStreamedPerTick -= stream.ethPerTick;
        ethStreamEndingAtTick[stream.lastTick] -= stream.ethPerTick;

        // calculate how much needs to be refunded
        uint256 ticksLeft = stream.lastTick - currentTick;
        uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;
        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amountToRefund }('');
        require(sent, 'failed to send eth');

        emit StreamCanceled(nounId, amountToRefund, ethStreamedPerTick);
}
```
Afther the moment that this `streamLastTick` is below the `currentTick`, the value of `ethStreamedPerTick` will be exceeded to exact value and `currentTick` will be never updated by [StreamEscrow.sol::L144](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L144).

```solidity
function forwardAll() public {
        ...
        sendETHToTreasury(ethStreamedPerTick);
        ...
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin allows the malicious users to create streams. 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice and Bob participate in NounsHouseAuction and receive nouns.
2. Both of them don't call cancelStream() and Alice set Bob as the operator of her noun. Then they have to get allowance to create streams. It's possible because they are all owners of nouns that received from NounsHouseAuction.
3. After that, they execute createStream() at the same time with Alice's nounId. Here, Bob may pay more than Alice's pay.
4. Alice calls cancelStream().


### Impact

The owner of the noun would receive incorrect amountToRefund and `currentTick` will be never updated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `locked` modifier in `createStream()` function.

```solidity
bool public _locked;
modifier locked () {
    require(!_locked, "Already in processing")
    _locked = true;
    _;
    _locked = false;
}
```
