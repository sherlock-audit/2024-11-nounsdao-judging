# Stuck Funds in StreamEscrow Due to Lack of Periodic forwardAll() Calls

### Summary

The forwardAll() function in the StreamEscrow contract does not adhere to its documented behavior, which states that it forwards all pending ETH streams if at least minimumTickDuration seconds have passed since the last forward. Instead, it only forwards ETH streams for the same day, not all pending streams. Also If this function is not called regularly each day, the accumulated ETH remains in the contract. The contract lacks an internal mechanism to automatically trigger this function, relying solely on external calls.




### Root Cause

In the StreamEscrow contract, the forwardAll() function is documented to forward all pending ETH streams if at least minimumTickDuration seconds have passed since the last forward.

However, the implementation only forwards ETH streams for the same day, not all pending streams. This discrepancy arises from the line:

If this function is not called regularly, the accumulated ETH remains in the contract. The contract lacks an internal mechanism to automatically trigger this function, relying solely on external calls.
