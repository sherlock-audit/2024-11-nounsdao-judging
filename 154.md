# Exploitation of `fastForwardStream` to Scam Secondary NFT Buyers

### Summary

The contract permits the auction winner to exploit the `fastForwardStream` function to scam a new NFT owner during a resale auction. By accepting a winning bid and fast-forwarding the stream in the same transaction, the original auction winner can fraudulently transfer all remaining ETH stream value to the DAO, leaving the new owner uncompensated.

Link to the function:  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L197-L224

### Root Cause

The `fastForwardStream` function does not account for scenarios where the NFT is sold to a new owner. The original owner (auction winner) retains the ability to manipulate the stream value even after transferring ownership of the NFT, creating a loophole for abuse.



### Internal pre-conditions

An NFT has been auctioned, and a winner has been determined.
The winner can return the NFT to cancel the stream and withdraw the unstreamed funds.

### External pre-conditions

The winner lists the NFT for sale in a secondary auction.
A buyer places a winning bid for the NFT.
The buyer assumes they are purchasing the NFT along with the remaining stream value intact.

### Attack Path

The original auction winner lists the NFT in a new auction.

A new buyer places a winning bid for the NFT.

In the same transaction, the original winner:

Accepts the winning bid for the NFT.
Calls the `fastForwardStream` function, forwarding all remaining stream ETH to the DAO.
Exploit Details:

The new owner receives the NFT but inherits no remaining stream value, as the funds have already been forwarded to the DAO by the previous owner.

### Impact

Scam Potential: The original winner effectively double-dips by selling the NFT and exploiting the stream value.
Loss to Buyer: The new buyer suffers financial loss, as they receive an NFT without the expected associated streaming value.
DAO Integrity Risk: Exploits like this could harm the contract’s reputation and trust among participants.


### PoC

1. Assume the following:  
   - Auction winner (Alice) wins NFT ID `123` with a bid of 10 ETH.  
   - 20% of the bid (2 ETH) goes to the DAO upfront; the remaining 8 ETH is streamed over time.  
   - Alice lists the NFT in a new auction.  
   - Bob places a winning bid of 6 ETH for NFT ID `123`.  

Exploit Execution:
Alice executes the following steps in a single transaction:
1. Step 1: Alice accepts Bob’s 6 ETH bid for NFT ID `123`.  
2. Step 2: Alice calls `fastForwardStream` to forward the remaining 8 ETH stream directly to the DAO.  

```solidity
function attack(uint256 nounId, uint256 winningBid, uint32 ticksToForward) public {
    auctionContract.acceptBid(nounId, winningBid); // Alice accepts Bob's bid
    auctionContract.fastForwardStream(nounId, ticksToForward); // Alice fast-forwards remaining stream
}
```
Results:
- Alice gains 6 ETH from Bob’s bid and forwards the remaining 8 ETH stream to the DAO.  
- Bob is left with NFT ID `123` but no associated stream value. 

### Mitigation

Require DAO Approval for Fast-Forwarding
Introduce a layer of governance by requiring the DAO to approve `fastForwardStream` requests, especially when ownership of the NFT has changed.  

- How It Works:
  - `fastForwardStream` calls are routed through the DAO.  
  - The DAO checks whether the NFT ownership has changed and rejects suspicious requests.  

- Implementation:
  Modify `fastForwardStream` to include DAO approval:  
  ```solidity
  function fastForwardStream(uint256 nounId, uint32 ticksToForward) public {
      require(daoContract.approveFastForward(nounId, msg.sender), 'DAO approval required');
      // Existing logic
  }
  ```
- Advantages:
  - Adds an additional layer of security.  
  - Ensures that fast-forward requests are vetted for fairness.  

- Drawback: 
  - Increases reliance on DAO governance, which may introduce delays.  

Recommendation
The best mitigation depends on the desired functionality of the contract.
