# Failure in Auction Creation Will Pause the Auction House, Halting Auction Operations for the DAO

## Summary

A lack of proper error handling in the [settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L118) function will cause the Auction House to remain paused, halting auction operations for the DAO as the contract fails to create a new auction after settling the current one.

## Root Cause

In [NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol), the [settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L118) function sequentially calls `_settleAuction()` and `_createAuction()` without implementing error handling mechanisms.

```solidity
function settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction() external override whenNotPaused {
    _settleAuction();
    _createAuction();
}
```
If `_settleAuction()` executes successfully but `_createAuction()` fails (e.g., due to a revert in the `nouns.mint()` function), the contract remains in a paused state. This is because `_createAuction()` is responsible for initiating a new auction, and its failure leaves the contract paused without recovering or handling the error gracefully.

## Exploit Analysis

- An ongoing auction must be active and eligible for settlement.
- The function `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` must be called by an authorized actor (e.g., DAO executor).
- An unexpected failure in the `_createAuction()` function, such as a revert in the `nouns.mint()` call.
- An authorized actor calls `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` to settle the current auction and start a new one.
- The current auction is settled successfully, funds are distributed, and relevant state variables are updated.
- Due to unforeseen issues (e.g., `nouns.mint()` reverts because of a supply cap or minting restrictions), the `_createAuction()` function fails.
- Since there is no error handling (like try-catch), the contract remains in a paused state after the failure.

## Impact Assessment
Proceeds intended for streaming are halted, potentially freezing significant amounts of ETH within the contract.

## Mitigation Recommendations
Utilize Solidity's try-catch mechanism to handle potential failures in `_createAuction()`.

```solidity
function settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction() external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    _settleAuction();
    try _createAuction() {
        // Auction creation succeeded
    } catch {
        _unpause(); // Ensure the contract does not remain paused
        revert("Auction creation failed");
    }
}
```
