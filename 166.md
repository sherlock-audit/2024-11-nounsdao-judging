# Lack of EOA check for Noun owner leads to potential vulnerability

### Summary

 When the attacker owns the Noun NFT in the smart contract and not in the EOA they can define functions like `fallback` and `receive` in their contract which will leads to potential Re-entrancy or DOS attack in the `StreamEscrow.sol` contract.

### Root Cause

When the attacker owns the Noun in the smart contract he will describe the fallback function in that smart contract which will be used by calling the `cancelStream` function from the contract. Because this function contains :- 

```solidity
(bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amountToRefund }('');
require(sent, 'failed to send eth');
```

- While Re-entrancy, here msg.sender will be a malicious smart contract with fallback or receive function and upon receiving ether it triggers another function before the first function completes.
- While DOS, msg.sender will be a similar malicious contract with functions but the function like fallback can be a excessive gas consumable function which will result in the revert of the transaction in which the call will failt or it will prevent the cancelStream function from completing and blocks the refunds for all the user in same scenario.

### Attack Path

- [RE-Entrancy]
- 1. Initialize the Stream as the owner of the Noun (holding Noun in the smart contract). The contract includes malicious fallback function.
- 2. Now the attacker calls the `cancelStream` function . It will trigger the  `call` and the `fallback` function from the malicious contract executes.
- 3. The `fallback` function again call the `cancelStream` function before the first execution finishes.
- 4. This way attacker can withdraw funds multiple times because state will not update fully before execution completes. This could result in draining the contract of Ether .
- [DOS]
- When the `cancelStream()` function is called and tries to refund Ether to the attacker's contract the `call` fails becaue the fallback function consume  all gas or it will reverts.

### Impact

Loss of funds from the treasury in the form of refund or legit user unable to call the function for cancelling the stream.

### Mitigation

Try adding checks which will only allow EOA to hold Nouns or use Openzeppelin reentrancy protection contract.
