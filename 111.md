# Auction extension logic breaking daily auction schedule

### Summary

The auction system in the `NounsAuctionHouseV2` contract allows the auction end time to be extended if a bid is placed close to the end, using a `timeBuffer`. This extension mechanism can cause delays in starting the next auction, breaking the rule that one Noun should be auctioned every 24 hours. The issue arises when the next auction's end time exceeds 24 hours from the previous auction’s end time due to extensions. The contract should ensure that the next auction always starts exactly 24 hours after the previous one or ends at exactly same time, regardless of extensions. 

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is that the auction extension mechanism allows the end time of the current auction to be extended beyond the expected 24-hour cycle, which can delay the creation of the next auction. This happens because:

1. **Auction Extension on Bids:** When a bid is placed within the `timeBuffer` of the auction's end time, the auction is extended by the `timeBuffer`. This pushes the auction's end time further into the future.

2. **New Auction Creation Logic:** When `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` is called to create a new auction, it sets the start time of the new auction to `block.timestamp` (current block timestamp) and the end time to `startTime + duration`. If the current auction was extended, the end time of the new auction could be more than 24 hours from the previous auction’s end time, violating the rule that a new auction must start every 24 hours.

3. **Auction Timing and Delays:** The time buffer extension means that one or more auctions may be skipped, leading to periods where no Noun is auctioned, breaking the "one Noun per day" rule.

This issue results from not enforcing a fixed, continuous 24-hour cycle for auctions and allowing extensions to push the cycle off track.

### Impact

**Disruption of Auction Schedule**:  
   The system promises one Noun auction every day. Repeated bid extensions break this schedule, potentially causing days without any auctions.



### PoC

1. **Setup**:
   - Auction starts at 23:50 UTC on 11/28/2024, ends at 23:50 UTC on 11/29/2024.
   - Time buffer is 30 minutes.
   - Auction duration is 24 hours.

2. **Exploit**:
   - A bid is placed at 23:45 UTC on 11/29/2024, extending the auction by 30 minutes to 00:15 UTC on 11/30/2024.
   - Repeated bids can extend the auction indefinitely, preventing a new auction from starting.

3. **Outcome**:
   - No new auction begins on 11/29/2024 because the current auction keeps extending.

This breaks the intended schedule of **one auction per day**.

### Mitigation

1. **Auction End Time Validation**:
   - Prevent the auction from extending beyond a 24-hour window from its original start time.
   - Ensure the auction `endTime` is capped at `startTime + 24 hours` to avoid indefinite extensions.

2. **Limit Extensions**:
   - Introduce a cap on the number of allowed extensions (e.g., a maximum of 1 or 2 extensions).
   - After reaching the maximum extensions, no further bids should be accepted, and the auction should close.
