# Low `msg.value` in `createStream` lead to loss of precision in the ETH value that gets allocated per tick in `StreamEscrow.sol`

### Summary

Low `msg.value` in `createStream` lead to loss of precision in the ETH value that gets allocated per tick in `StreamEscrow.sol`

### Root Cause

The `createStream` function does not currently validate if `msg.value` is too small relative to the stream length.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L118
```solidity
uint128 ethPerTick = toUint128(msg.value / streamLengthInTicks);
```
If `msg.value` is too small compared to `streamLengthInTicks`, the result of the division will be 0, which means `ethPerTick` will be set to 0.

This could lead to the following problems:
1. The stream will technically be created, but no ETH will be sent in each tick, essentially making the stream ineffective.
2. Even though no ETH will be streamed, the contract still executes logic to register the stream, which consumes unnecessary gas.
3. Users may not understand why their stream is created but not funded.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Suppose `msg.value = 0.01` ether and `streamLengthInTicks = 1000`. Here's how the calculation goes:

1. `ethPerTick = 0.01 ether / 1000 = 0.00001 ether`.
2. Since `ethPerTick` is cast to a uint128, which has limited precision, the value round down to 0 if it's too small.
3. So, if the ETH allocated per tick is less than the smallest unit (like 0.000000000000000001 ether for Ethereum's smallest unit, wei), it will be rounded down to 0.

### Impact

1. If the value is too low, the stream won't have any ETH allocated to it, which essentially nullifies the creation of the stream.
2. Even if no ETH is streamed, the function execution still consumes gas to create and store the stream, which could frustrate users and waste resources.
3. Users might not realize why the stream exists but isn't actually streaming any funds. This could lead to confusion or mistrust in the contractâ€™s behavior.

pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../contracts/StreamEscrow.sol";

contract CreateStreamLowValueTest is Test {
    StreamEscrow public escrow;

    function setUp() public {
        escrow = new StreamEscrow(
            address(this), // DAO executor
            address(this), // ETH recipient
            address(this), // Nouns recipient
            address(this), // Nouns token mock
            address(this), // Stream creator
            1              // Minimum tick duration
        );
    }

    function testCreateStreamLowValue() public {
        vm.deal(address(this), 1 ether); // Fund the test account

        uint256 lowValue = 1 wei; // Low ETH value that will be too small for streaming
        uint16 streamLengthInTicks = 1000; // Large stream length

        // Expect the stream to be created but with 0 ETH per tick
        escrow.createStream{value: lowValue}(1, streamLengthInTicks);

        // Retrieve the stream and check if ethPerTick is 0 (meaning no ETH was streamed per tick)
        StreamEscrow.Stream memory stream = escrow.getStream(1);
        assertEq(stream.ethPerTick, 0, "ETH per tick should be 0 due to low value");
    }
}
```
When running the test, the result is that the stream is created, but the `ethPerTick` is set to 0, as the `msg.value` is too low for the given `streamLengthInTicks`.

### Mitigation

```solidity
function createStream(uint256 nounId, uint16 streamLengthInTicks) public payable {
    require(streamLengthInTicks > 0, "streamLengthInTicks must be greater than zero");
    require(msg.value >= streamLengthInTicks, "msg.value is too low for the given stream length");

    require(allowedToCreateStream[msg.sender], "not allowed");
    require(isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, nounId), "only noun owner or approved");
    require(!isStreamActive(nounId), "stream active");

    // Now calculate ethPerTick
    uint128 ethPerTick = toUint128(msg.value / streamLengthInTicks);
    ...
}
```
This ensures that the caller provides enough ETH to cover at least 1 wei per tick (depending on the stream length).
It provides a clear error message when the msg.value is insufficient to create the stream, preventing unexpected behavior.
