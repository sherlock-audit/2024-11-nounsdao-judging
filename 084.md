# Bidders can disincentivize users from bidding by artificially increasing the NFT price

### Summary

Bidders can disincentivize users from bidding by artificially increasing the NFT price. At the current market state, the price increase can be more than 5$ and could go up significantly higher during times of network congestion and ETH price increase.

### Root Cause

Whenever there is a new bid, we send the previous bid amount to the previous bidder using this function:
```solidity
function _safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 value) internal returns (bool) {
        bool success;
        assembly {
            success := call(30000, to, value, 0, 0, 0, 0)
        }
        return success;
    }
```
If it fails, we wrap the ETH and send it over. This is done so the user can not block new bids by consuming too much gas or reverting in the `receive()` function.

However, due to the 30000 gas limit, this is abusable and the price of the NFT can be artificially increased. 

Let's take an average gas price on the Ethereum chain (chain the protocol is to be deployed on) from 1-2 weeks ago (November 13, 2024), 51 gwei. To convert 30000 gas to a dollar value, we multiply 30000 by 51 which equals 1_530_000. This is the gwei that has to be paid for 30000 gas - at current prices of ~3685\$, this results in 5.63805\$ of gas.

### Attack Path

1. User bids 1 wei for an NFT (through a contract) and has a `receive()` function which consumes all of the 30_000 gas provided to it (`reservePrice` is set to 1 in the [currently deployed contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x830bd73e4184cef73443c15111a1df14e495c706#readProxyContract))
2. Users value the NFT at 5\$ due to some factors
3. Whenever users bid for the NFT, the price will not actually be 1 wei but 5.50\$ due to the gas consumption, the price is indirectly and artificially increased
4. No one bids for the NFT as it would be a clear loss of funds for them despite the current bid being much lower than its actual value
5. The user receives the NFT for essentially free as 1 wei is a minuscule amount of funds

### Impact

Users can artificially increase the price of the NFT by more than 5\$ at current prices with absolutely no risk. As we are in a bull market, the ETH price can easily double, if not triple/quadruple, while the same applying for the gas prices. These 5\$ can easily grow to 10, 15 or even more than 20\$.

The current `reservePrice` which is the initial price of the NFT is set to 1 wei in the currently live contracts. This means that by default, the increase of price is 1530000000000000 times (converted the gwei cost to wei) the initial price, this classifies as a High.

### Mitigation

Consider wrapping to WETH directly without trying to send any ETH.
