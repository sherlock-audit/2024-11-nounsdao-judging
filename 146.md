# Users can still use `createBid` if the contract is paused

### Summary

Users can still bid on the current ongoing auction while the contract is paused. That way, they can increase the `endTime` of the auction by bidding within `timeBuffer` of the auction endtime and therefore noone would be able to use `_settleAuction`. Pause and unpause were included for emergency situations and for emergency upgrades. But the contract won't be able to be upgraded while an auction is active and ongoing. 

### Root Cause

`NounsAuctionHouseV3::createBid` doesn't check if the contract is paused or not.:
```javascript
    function createBid(uint256 nounId, uint32 clientId) public payable override {
        INounsAuctionHouseV3.AuctionV2 memory _auction = auctionStorage;

        (uint192 _reservePrice, uint56 _timeBuffer, uint8 _minBidIncrementPercentage) =
            (reservePrice, timeBuffer, minBidIncrementPercentage);

        require(_auction.nounId == nounId, "Noun not up for auction");
        require(block.timestamp < _auction.endTime, "Auction expired");
        require(msg.value >= _reservePrice, "Must send at least reservePrice");
        require(
            msg.value >= _auction.amount + ((_auction.amount * _minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
            "Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount"
        );

        auctionStorage.clientId = clientId;
        auctionStorage.amount = uint128(msg.value);
        auctionStorage.bidder = payable(msg.sender);

        bool extended = _auction.endTime - block.timestamp < _timeBuffer;

        emit AuctionBid(_auction.nounId, msg.sender, msg.value, extended);
        if (clientId > 0) emit AuctionBidWithClientId(_auction.nounId, msg.value, clientId);

        if (extended) {
            auctionStorage.endTime = _auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + _timeBuffer);
            emit AuctionExtended(_auction.nounId, _auction.endTime);
        }

        address payable lastBidder = _auction.bidder;

        // Refund the last bidder, if applicable
        if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
            _safeTransferETHWithFallback(lastBidder, _auction.amount);
        }
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. Bob creates a bid
2. Owner pauses the contract because of an upgrade needed for example(can be something else)
3. Bob can still bid in the `_timeBuffer` range, therefore increasing the `endTime` of the auction
4. Contract can't be upgraded because auction is still active and can't be settled because "block.timestamp < _auction.endTime".

### Impact

Contract can't be upgraded or made any changes. If it's an emergency, the mitigation could be delayed because of that.

### Mitigation

Use `WhenNotPaused` modifier from OpenZeppelin which the contract already inherit from on `NounsAuctionHouseV3::createBid` .
