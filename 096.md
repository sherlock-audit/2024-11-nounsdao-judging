# When auction is nearing it end, it will not extend as expected when a user `createBid`

### Summary

When a bidder `createBid` inside both `NounsAuctionHouseV2` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3` when the time remaning of the auction is less than `_timeBuffer`  and a user bids on an auction, it normally needs to extend it with the timeBuffer set by the admin.

However this does not happen as the endTime is not extended with the timeBuffer, but the  current bidder's `createBid` block.timestamp is extended with the timeBuffer.

Which will cause the auction endTime to be set much earlier than the expected timeBuffer.

```solidity
        // Extend the auction if the bid was received within `timeBuffer` of the auction end time
        bool extended = _auction.endTime - block.timestamp < _timeBuffer;

        emit AuctionBid(_auction.nounId, msg.sender, msg.value, extended);
        if (clientId > 0) emit AuctionBidWithClientId(_auction.nounId, msg.value, clientId);

        if (extended) {
            auctionStorage.endTime = _auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + _timeBuffer);
            emit AuctionExtended(_auction.nounId, _auction.endTime);
        }
        ```
        
 block.timestamp is added to the _timeBuffer instead of the auction end time.
 
 ```solidity
 auctionStorage.endTime = _auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + _timeBuffer);
 ```

### Root Cause

In both NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol and NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol, when a bid is created with `CreateBid` and the time remaining of the auction is less than the time_buffer.

It will use the block.timestamp instead of the auction end time,

Lets assume:
**_timeBuffer = 15 minutes.**
**Contest ending in 10 minutes.**
**User submits a bid 10 minutes before the end of the auction.**

```solidity
  bool extended = _auction.endTime - block.timestamp < _timeBuffer;
  ```
This will be true as there are less than 15 minutes remaning if you substract  _auction.endTime with block.timestamp as the contest is ending in 10 minutes in this example.
  
 
  ```solidity
        if (extended) {
            auctionStorage.endTime = _auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + _timeBuffer);
            emit AuctionExtended(_auction.nounId, _auction.endTime);
        }
```
Now auctionsStorage.endTime will be changed into block.timestamp + _timeBuffer, which will be 10 minutes before the auction is ending + 15 mins. 
 
Which will only add 5 minutes to the endTime instead of the 15 minutes which is expected, the issue arises
with adding the block.timestamp with the _timeBuffer, instead of the adding the _auction.endTime with the _timeBuffer.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- The auctions will not get extended by the timebuffer as expected.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the timeBuffer on top of the auction.endTime instead of the block.timestamp, so you can make sure the endTime is extended correctly with the _timeBuffer
