# Analysis and Proposal for Stream Cancellation Flow in Stream Escrow Contract

### Summary

The user proposes an alternative flow: upon cancellation, the remaining ETH should be directed back to the contract instead of being refunded to the user, and the Noun token should remain with the user. This would prevent users from losing both their assets (ETH and Noun token) when canceling the stream early.

### Root Cause

When a user cancels an ETH stream early, the user loses both the remaining ETH and their Noun token in the current implementation. This is problematic because the user should ideally be able to retain their Noun token while sending the unused ETH back to the contract, not losing both.

### Attack Path

When a user cancels an ETH stream early, the user loses both the remaining ETH and their Noun token in the current implementation. This is problematic because the user should ideally be able to retain their Noun token while sending the unused ETH back to the contract, not losing both.

### Impact

 Users will no longer receive the remaining ETH if they cancel the stream. Instead, the ETH will be retained by the contract. This change means that users won't get their funds back upon cancellation, which could be seen as a disadvantage, especially if they were expecting to receive a refund.
For certain use cases, this change may be more desirable for the contract or DAO, as the ETH remains within the system, which could be used for future operations or rewards.
If users expect a refund of unused ETH upon cancellation, this change could create dissatisfaction and potentially impact user trust.

### PoC

### Mitigation

To implement the mitigation solution, where the user retains their Noun token and the unused ETH is sent back to the contract (instead of being refunded directly to the user), we need to adjust the cancelStream function in the contract. Hereâ€™s the updated code for the cancelStream function:
```solidity
sendETHToTreasury(amountToRefund);
```
