# Recipient contract may Lock WETH due to unsafe fallback transfer

### Summary

Missing validation of recipient's WETH handling capability will cause permanent loss of funds for ETH refund recipients as recipient contracts will trap WETH tokens in contracts without withdrawal functionality.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L304C1-L309C6

```solidity
function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!_safeTransferETH(to, amount)) {
            IWETH(weth).deposit{ value: amount }();
            IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount);
        }
    }
```


In NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol:_safeTransferETHWithFallback there is a missing check on the recipient's ability to handle WETH tokens.

Once WETH tokens transfer to recipient contract, if recipient contract lacks of function to execute function withdraw or approve or transfer or transferFrom in the WETH contract, the user will  not be able to withdraw WETH or ETH.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The auction participants suffer permanent loss of funds when refunds are sent to their contracts that cannot handle WETH. The recipient contracts can unintentionally lock their own funds by not implementing proper WETH handling functionality, potentially leading to significant value being permanently inaccessible.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add validation before attempting WETH transfer:
```solidity
function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    if (!_safeTransferETH(to, amount)) {
+        // Check if recipient is a contract
+        uint256 codeSize;
+        assembly {
+            codeSize := extcodesize(to)
+       }
        
+       if (codeSize > 0) {
+            // Verify contract can handle WETH
+            require(
+                IWETHReceiver(to).canReceiveWETH(),
+                "Recipient cannot handle WETH"
+           );
+        }
        
        IWETH(weth).deposit{ value: amount }();
        IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount),

    }
}
```
