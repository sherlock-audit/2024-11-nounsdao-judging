# user will withdraw more eth than he suppose

### Summary

user will withdraw more eth than he suppose to due to not triggering forwardAll before executing cancelStream

### Root Cause

Whenever streams are being created there is check to process all pending ETH streams if at least `minimumTickDuration` seconds has passed since last forward - `forwardAll`

```solidity
        if (amountToStream > 0) {
->            streamEscrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream{ value: amountToStream }(_auction.nounId, streamLengthInTicks);
        } else {
        
...
    function forwardAllAndCreateStream(uint256 nounId, uint16 streamLengthInTicks) external payable {
        forwardAll();

        createStream(nounId, streamLengthInTicks);
    }
```

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Forwards all pending ETH streams if at least `minimumTickDuration` seconds has passed since last forward.
     * @dev This function silently returns if called before `minimumTickDuration` have elapsed since last forward.
     */
    function forwardAll() public {
..
    }
```

Whenever user calls cancelStream `block.timestamp` might be more than `lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration` which leads to incorrectly withdraws more to user than it should according to streams.

```solidity
    function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
        require(isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream not active');

        // transfer noun to treasury
        nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);

        // cancel stream
        streams[nounId].canceled = true;
        Stream memory stream = streams[nounId];
        ethStreamedPerTick -= stream.ethPerTick;
        ethStreamEndingAtTick[stream.lastTick] -= stream.ethPerTick;

        // calculate how much needs to be refunded
        uint256 ticksLeft = stream.lastTick - currentTick;
        uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;
        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amountToRefund }('');
        require(sent, 'failed to send eth');

        emit StreamCanceled(nounId, amountToRefund, ethStreamedPerTick);
    }

```

E.x. `currentTick = 5` `block.timestamp >= lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration` `stream.lastTick = 10`
user will be able to withdraw `(10 - 5)*stream.ethPerTick` instead of `(10 - 6)*stream.ethPerTick` due to not updating currentTick(not settling auction on time)
### Internal pre-conditions

1. block.timestamp >= lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration (operator didn't trigger `settleAuction` in time)
2. user calls cancelStream to withdraw his eth

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none, users sometimes will withdraw more than suppose to

### Impact

users sometimes will withdraw more than suppose to which leads to protocol not getting the amount it suppose to get.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
    function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
+        forwardAll();
        require(isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream not active');

        // transfer noun to treasury
        nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);

        // cancel stream

```
