# DAO won't receive full ETH streams in edge case

### Summary

In the StreamEscrow.cancelStream() function, owner of noun can cancel the stream and receive unstreamed funds. When at least `minimumTickDuration` seconds has passed since last forward, the function `StreamEscrow.forwardAll()` is invoked and all pending ETH streams are sending to DAO.

However, if owner of noun want to cancel his stream at the same time, he can front-run this transaction and don't send `ethPerTick` amount of ETH to DAO. As result, DAO won't get stream it deserves.

### Root Cause

In the [StreamEscrow.sol:167](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L167) function, owner of noun can cancel the stream and receive unstreamed funds.

```solidity
167 function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
        require(isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream not active');

        // transfer noun to treasury
        nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);

        // cancel stream
        streams[nounId].canceled = true;
        Stream memory stream = streams[nounId];
        ethStreamedPerTick -= stream.ethPerTick;
        ethStreamEndingAtTick[stream.lastTick] -= stream.ethPerTick;

        // calculate how much needs to be refunded
        uint256 ticksLeft = stream.lastTick - currentTick;
        uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;
        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amountToRefund }('');
        require(sent, 'failed to send eth');

        emit StreamCanceled(nounId, amountToRefund, ethStreamedPerTick);
    }
```

If the time passes more than `minimumTickDuration`, then the function `StreamEscrow.forwardAll()` can be invoked to foward all pending stream and DAO expects it will receive all ETH streams.

At the same time, assume that Alice want to cancel her stream. Because at least `minimumTickDuration` seconds has passed from `lastForwardTimestamp`, the stream of Alice for current tick should be sent to DAO.

However, Alice can front-run this transaction which is invoking `StreamEscrow.forwardAll()` with her transaction involving `cancelStream()` and don't send `ethPerTick` amount of ETH to DAO.

As result, Alice cancels her stream before all ETH streams are sent to DAO and DAO won't get stream it deserves.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

DAO won't get full stream as it deserves due to front-running attack with `cancelStream()`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recomended to add `StreamEscrow.forwardAll()` function to `StreamEscrow.cancelStream()`.
