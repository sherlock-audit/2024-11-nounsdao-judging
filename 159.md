# Owner can affect client rewards by setting settlement history for unsettled/non-existent auctions in `NounsAuctionHouseV2`

### Summary

The lack of input validation in `setPrices` function will cause incorrect reward distributions for auction clients as owner can set settlement history for unsettled or non-existent auctions, creating inconsistency between actual auction states and settlement records used for reward calculations.

### Root Cause

In [`NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol:329-336`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L329-L336) the `setPrices` function lacks validation checks that would prevent setting settlement history for:
1. Current auction's nounId while the auction is still unsettled
2. Non-existent auctions (nounIds greater than current auction's nounId)

This creates inconsistency in historical data where [`getSettlements`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L500-L530) and [`getSettlementsFromIdtoTimestamp`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L452-L488) may return settlement records for auctions that are either still active or haven't occurred yet, affecting the accuracy of client reward calculations that depend on this historical data.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Owner needs to have access to `setPrices` function (already satisfied by `onlyOwner` modifier)
2. An auction needs to be currently active with `nounId` that hasn't been settled
3. The reward distribution system needs to be enabled (`auctionRewardsEnabled` is true)

### External pre-conditions

None. The issue exists independently of external conditions.

### Attack Path

1. An auction with `nounId` X is currently active and unsettled
2. Owner calls `setPrices` with settlement data for either:
   - The current nounId X (unsettled auction)
   - A nounId greater than X (non-existent auction)
3. The settlement history is updated with this data
4. Client reward calculations query this data through:
   - `getSettlements` for counting rewards
   - `getSettlementsFromIdtoTimestamp` for historical data
5. The reward system uses this inconsistent data to calculate client rewards, leading to incorrect distributions

### Impact

The impact is considered MEDIUM because:

1. **Reward Distribution Integrity**:
   - Client rewards could be calculated based on incorrect settlement data
   - This affects the fairness of reward distribution among clients
   - Could lead to over/under rewarding of clients

2. **Limited Financial Impact**:
   - No direct loss of funds
   - Cannot affect active auctions or token transfers
   - Impact is limited to reward calculations

3. **Governance Control**:
   - Function is controlled by owner (DAO)
   - Changes are transparent and visible on-chain
   - Community can monitor and detect inconsistencies

4. **Recovery Possible**:
   - Incorrect data can be corrected through governance
   - Historical events provide accurate data for verification
   - Reward calculations can be adjusted if needed

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the following validation checks to the `setPrices` function:

```solidity
function setPrices(SettlementNoClientId[] memory settlements) external onlyOwner {
    uint256 currentNounId = auctionStorage.nounId;
    bool isCurrentAuctionSettled = auctionStorage.settled;
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < settlements.length; ++i) {
        // Check 1: Cannot set data for current auction unless it's settled
        if (settlements[i].nounId == currentNounId - 1) {
            require(isCurrentAuctionSettled, "Cannot set price for unsettled current auction");
        }
        
        // Check 2: Cannot set data for future auctions
        require(settlements[i].nounId < currentNounId, "Cannot set price for non-existent auctions");
        
        settlementHistory[settlements[i].nounId] = SettlementState({
            blockTimestamp: settlements[i].blockTimestamp,
            amount: uint256ToUint64Price(settlements[i].amount),
            winner: settlements[i].winner,
            clientId: 0
        });
    }
    emit SettlementHistoryUpdated(settlements);
}
```
