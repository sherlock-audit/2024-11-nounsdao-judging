# vah - Reentrancy Vulnerability in StreamEscrow Contract

### Summary

A reentrancy vulnerability exists in the `StreamEscrow` contract within the `cancelStream` and `sendETHToTreasury` functions. These functions perform external calls (ETH transfers) without appropriate reentrancy protection, allowing an attacker to perform a reentrancy attack and manipulate the contract's state, potentially leading to loss of funds or other unintended behaviors.

### Root Cause

Location
Contract: [StreamEscrow.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L155)
Contract: [Functions: cancelStream, sendETHToTreasurysendETHToTreasury](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L303)

### Attack Path

1. **Deploy malicious contract**  
   The attacker deploys a contract named `ReentrancyAttack` that contains a fallback function designed to re-enter the `cancelStream` function of the `StreamEscrow` contract.

2. **Create an active stream**  
   The attacker ensures they have an active stream by calling `createStream` on the `StreamEscrow` contract with their `nounId` and sending the required ETH to initiate the stream.

3. **Approve Noun token transfer**  
   The attacker calls `nounsToken.approve(StreamEscrowAddress, nounId)` to allow the `StreamEscrow` contract to transfer their Noun token on their behalf.

4. **Initiate the attack**  
   The attacker calls the `attack` function on their `ReentrancyAttack` contract to begin the exploitation process.

5. **First call to `cancelStream`**  
   Inside the `attack` function, the `ReentrancyAttack` contract calls the `cancelStream` function on the `StreamEscrow` contract, initiating the stream cancellation process.

6. **Transfer of Noun token**  
   The `StreamEscrow` contract transfers the Noun token from the attacker to the `nounsRecipient` address as part of the stream cancellation process.

7. **State update deferred**  
   The `StreamEscrow` contract schedules updates to the stream's state variables but does not apply them before making an external call.

8. **External call triggers fallback**  
   The `StreamEscrow` contract attempts to send ETH back to the attacker's contract using `msg.sender.call{ value: amountToRefund }('')`, triggering the fallback function in the attacker's contract.

9. **Re-enter `cancelStream`**  
   The fallback function in the `ReentrancyAttack` contract re-enters the `cancelStream` function before the state variables are updated, allowing the attacker to repeat the cancellation process.

10. **Repeat cancellation**  
    Steps 5â€“9 are repeated multiple times, enabling the attacker to cancel the same stream multiple times and receive the refund each time.

11. **Drain funds**  
    Through repeated reentrancy, the attacker drains ETH from the `StreamEscrow` contract, exploiting the vulnerability and depleting its balance.

### Impact

The contract suffers a significant loss of ETH equal to multiple times the refund amount of the canceled stream.
