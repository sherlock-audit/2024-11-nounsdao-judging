# Missing check ownership of function forwardAll()

### Summary

The missing check of owner of this function has reentrancy attack risk. And also everyone can call this function to do forwardAll() if time is required. The only check is block.time should be at least mimimumTickDuration, while it's not enough. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L136-L149

If the attacker has the condition of wait time of minimumTickDuration to do reentrancy attack, the forwardAll function will not defend it. And the money will be sent to ethRecipient.
