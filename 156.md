# Silent WETH transfer failure will cause loss of funds for bidders and treasury in `NounsAuctionHouseV3`

### Summary

The missing return value check in WETH transfer will cause a loss of funds for bidders and treasury as failed WETH transfers in the fallback mechanism silently succeed without actual value transfer, affecting both refunds to previous bidders and treasury settlements.

### Root Cause

In [`NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol:365-370`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L365-L370) the WETH transfer return value is not checked in the fallback logic:
```solidity
function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    if (!_safeTransferETH(to, amount)) {
        IWETH(weth).deposit{ value: amount }();
        IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount);  // @audit return value not checked
    }
}
```

This function is called in two critical paths:
1. In [`createBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L181) to refund previous bidders: `_safeTransferETHWithFallback(lastBidder, _auction.amount)`
2. In [`_settleAuction()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L337) to transfer auction proceeds to treasury: `_safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), amountToSendTreasury)`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An auction must have at least one bid to have funds to transfer
2. ETH transfer must fail, triggering the WETH fallback path
   - This is likely due to the low gas limit (30,000) in `_safeTransferETH`
3. The contract must have sufficient ETH to perform the WETH deposit
4. For treasury settlement, `immediateTreasuryBPs` must be greater than 0 to have funds to transfer

### External pre-conditions

1. The recipient address must be a contract with one of these conditions:
   - Complex receive function that requires more than 30,000 gas
   - Contract that cannot receive WETH (e.g., blacklisted or not implemented)
2. WETH contract must be operational (not paused) to allow deposit

### Attack Path

1. A bidder participates in an auction with a bid amount X
2. A new higher bid comes in, triggering `_safeTransferETHWithFallback(lastBidder, _auction.amount)` in `createBid()`
3. The ETH refund fails because the bidder is a contract requiring >30,000 gas
4. The contract attempts WETH fallback:
   - Successfully wraps ETH to WETH
   - Attempts to transfer WETH to the bidder
   - Transfer fails but no revert occurs
5. Transaction completes successfully despite failed transfer
6. Similarly, during auction settlement, a portion of proceeds (determined by `immediateTreasuryBPs`) triggers `_safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), amountToSendTreasury)` in `_settleAuction()`, which can fail silently in the same way

### Impact

The protocol suffers from two critical impacts:

1. **Bidder Fund Loss**: Previous bidders suffer a complete loss of their bid amount when outbid. When called from `createBid()`, `_safeTransferETHWithFallback(lastBidder, _auction.amount)` can fail silently, causing the refund to be stuck in the auction contract with no recovery mechanism.

2. **Treasury Fund Loss**: The DAO treasury suffers a loss of immediate auction proceeds. When called from `_settleAuction()`, `_safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), amountToSendTreasury)` can fail silently, causing the immediate portion of auction proceeds (determined by `immediateTreasuryBPs`) to remain stuck in the contract instead of being transferred to the treasury.

The severity is considered HIGH because:
- Direct loss of user and protocol funds
- No recovery mechanism available
- Affects core auction functionality
- Can impact multiple auctions and users
- Nouns auctions typically involve significant amounts of ETH
- In V3, this affects both immediate treasury transfers and user refunds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Short-term**: Add return value check for WETH transfer:
```solidity
function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    if (!_safeTransferETH(to, amount)) {
        IWETH(weth).deposit{ value: amount }();
        require(IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount), "WETH transfer failed");
    }
}
```

2. **Long-term**:
- Consider using `safeTransfer` from OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library
- Consider increasing the gas limit in `_safeTransferETH` to reduce fallback scenarios
- Add events for fallback transfers to improve monitoring and transparency
- Consider implementing a recovery mechanism for stuck funds
- Consider adding specific events for V3's immediate treasury transfers to better track successful settlements
