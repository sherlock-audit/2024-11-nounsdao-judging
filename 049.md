# `forwardAllAndCreateStream()` can be frontrunned to steal one tick worth of extra refunds

### Summary

At every auction settlement, the AuctionHouse contract calls `forwardAllAndCreateStream()`. In `forwardAll()` logic, `ethStreamedPerTick` is first transferred to `ethRecipient` and  then the `currentTick` is incremented.

This call is always made at a difference of 24 hours (== auction settlement duration) from the auctionHouse and `forwardAll()` only handles the fund transfer and increment logic if 24 hours have passed.

The problem is that if a user frontruns the `forwardAllAndCreateStream()` with a call to `cancelStream()` at the exact same time (ie. 24 hours since the `lastForwardTimestamp`, the user gets one tick worth of extra refund before the `currentTick` could be incremented. This causes a loss of 1 tick worth of stream amount for the DAO.

### Root Cause

`cancelStream()` does not check and increment the `currentTick` before calculating the deserved refund amount for a cancelled stream.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Lets assume that only one stream exists which has started just now, and its the start of the streamescrow so `currentTick == 0`.

1. Noun owner has a stream set up with 15 ETH of total stream, ie. `ethPerTick` of 0.01 ETH
2. Now 24 hours have passed since the stream was created
3. An auction settlement call is made in the AuctionHouse contract, which calls `forwardAllAndCreateStream() => forwardAll()`
4. The noun owner sees this txn and frontruns it with a call to `cancelStream()`
5. Because `cancelStream()` does not check/ increment the `currentTick`, the refund calculation assumes that number of ticks left == 1500 - 0 == 1500
6. The noun owner gets a refund of 15 ETH ie. the full amount even though 24 hours had passed since the stream was created. This is because the logic decreases `ethStreamedPerTick` without first checking that the current tick has ended (and if so it needs to send this last tick funds also to the DAO)
7. This results in the DAO getting nothing from the streaming even though the noun bid was escrowed for a full tick duration

This can happen for any streams in the whole lifecycle of the streamEscrow contract, and the DAO will lose 1 tick worth of funds that they deserve as per the mechanics of the system.

For our current example, the loss will be `0.01 ETH (15/1500)` and in percentage terms all streams can lose `(1/1500 * 100) ie. 0.0666~ %` of a single auction stream amount. 




### Impact

Dao loses one tick worth of funds because one extra tick worth of funds are refunded as the `currentTick` is not correctly incremented before the refund calculation. 

The extent of loss is 0.066~% so this is a medium severity issue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In `cancelStream()`, plug a call to `forwardAll()` to make sure that if the time has passed since `lastForwardTimestamp` then the tick should be incremented and funds sent to the treasury before doing any refund calculations (so that the correct `ethStreamedPerTick` is utilized first)

Because `forwardAll()` is public, this issue will be prevented if someone calls `forwardAll()` before the `cancelStream()` call could execute. But no one has an incentive to do that. There is no bot as the protocol has specifically stated that they are solely depending upon the auction settlement transaction itself to forward the stream. See https://mirror.xyz/verbsteam.eth/GYWRLqAC0heMC_2Fhc0ez0Mchxp_MCUIjoyt8UPGwrs#:~:text=Why%20use%20Auction%20House%20as%20the%20clock%3F

And if some user or a user-setup bot tries to waste gas and call `forwardAll()`, the attacker can also frontrun this transaction easily. The only solution is to plug `forwardAll()` in `cancelStream()`.
