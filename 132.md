# Is unfair for the current bidder to change the aution parameters while the auction is running.

### Summary

When the user does the bid is because did an analysis of the auction parameters and is unfair to change those parameters while the auction is running. Mainly the parameters that change the future resell price of a NFT, those are:
1) **streamEscrow**: Affect resell price because the cancel condition could change.
2) **immediateTreasuryBPs**: Directly affect the resell price because there is less fund to get if cancel the stream
3) **_streamLengthInTicks**: Affect resell price because the longer the ticks, the lower you pay for tick.


### Root Cause

in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L261-L290 is possible to change auction parameters when an auction is running and has a bidder.

2. An auction needs to have at least one bid.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1) Auction is created
2) User does a bid because analyzed the auction parameters like resell price of a nft
3) Admin change those parameters
4) User now has broken assumptions and is unfair

### Impact

### PoC

### Mitigation

Only change the auction parameters if there is no bids or no auction
