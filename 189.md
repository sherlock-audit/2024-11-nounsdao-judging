### **SUMMARY**
The `fastForwardMultipleStreams` function processes arrays of `nounIds` and `ticksToForward` to fast-forward multiple streams. However, the function lacks ownership validation for the `nounIds` before calling `fastForwardStream(nounIds[i], ticksToForward[i])`. This allows for unintended or unauthorized manipulation of streams by callers who do not own the `nounIds` in question.

---

### **ROOT CAUSE**
The absence of a check to ensure the caller owns each `nounId` being processed leads to potential misuse of the `fastForwardMultipleStreams` function.

---

### **PRECONDITIONS**
#### **Internal Precondition**
1. The `fastForwardStream` function does not verify ownership of the `nounId`.

#### **External Precondition**
1. A caller supplies an array of `nounIds` they do not own.

---

### **ATTACK PATH**
1. A malicious user calls `fastForwardMultipleStreams` with an array of `nounIds`, including IDs they do not own.
2. The function processes these IDs without validating ownership, potentially impacting streams belonging to other users.

---

### **IMPACT**
- Unauthorized manipulation of streams owned by other users.
- Potential disruption or misuse of streams, impacting system integrity.

---

### **PROOF OF CONCEPT (PoC)**



---

### **MITIGATION**
Add ownership validation for each `nounId` in the `fastForwardMultipleStreams` loop:

```solidity
function fastForwardMultipleStreams(uint256[] calldata nounIds, uint32[] calldata ticksToForward) external {
    require(nounIds.length == ticksToForward.length, "length mismatch");
    for (uint256 i; i < nounIds.length; ++i) {
        require(msg.sender == nounsToken.ownerOf(nounIds[i]), "Caller does not own nounId");
        fastForwardStream(nounIds[i], ticksToForward[i]);
    }
}
```
