# `cancelStream` is missing `forwardAll`, sometimes allowing the caller to refund 1 more tick than he should

### Summary

In StreamEscrow, ticks are incremented manually, meaning that even if it is possible to increment current tick and forward streams, it has to be triggered externally, via `forwardAll()`.

This is solved by using `forwardAllAndCreateStream` in AuctionHouse, so the new stream will have to bump the tick first (if it was not bumped manually in the last 24 hours). 

But `cancelStream` does not use `forwardAll`, so if the current tick is bumpable, the caller will still be able to cancel the stream without bumping the tick, receiving a refund for 1 more tick than he should.

### Root Cause

Missing `forwardAll` at the beginning of  `cancelStream`.

### Internal pre-conditions

block.timestamp >= lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration

### External pre-conditions

Owner of a Noun with an active stream decides to stop the stream.

### Attack Path

Alice wins the daily auction for 10 ETH

2 ETH are sent to the DAO immediately

8 ETH are streamed over 1500 days (0.005333... ETH per day)

25 hours later, while the next auction is still active due to auction extensions, Alice decides to ragequit. 

Alice calls `cancelStream` and gets refund for 1500 ticks instead of 1499, receiving 0.005333 ETH that should have been sent to the DAO instead.

### Impact

In certain cases, Noun holders get refund for 1 more tick than they should (`1 / 1875` of the price in the current configuration). 

### Mitigation

```diff
    function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
+       forwardAll();
```
