# User will lose ETH when WETH recipient has failing ETH transfer

### Summary

Missing WETH fallback handling in ETH transfer will cause loss of funds for users as failed ETH transfers to `ethRecipient` will revert the transaction instead of falling back to WETH

### Root Cause

In StreamEscrow.sol:304 the ETH transfer lacks WETH fallback handling when direct ETH transfer fails
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L303-L309

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract must have ETH balance > 0
2. `ethRecipient` must be set to valid address
3. `sendETHToTreasury()` must be called with amount > 0

### External pre-conditions

1. `ethRecipient` contract must be unable to receive direct ETH transfers (no receive/fallback function)

### Attack Path

1. User initiates stream settlement that triggers `sendETHToTreasury()`
2. ETH transfer to `ethRecipient` fails
3. Transaction reverts due to `require` check
4. ETH remains stuck in contract instead of being wrapped as WETH

### Impact

The protocol suffers from temporary fund locking and failed settlements. Users cannot complete stream settlements when direct ETH transfers fail.

### PoC

```solidity
contract TestRecipient {
    // No receive() or fallback() function
    // Will reject direct ETH transfers
}

function testFailedETHTransfer() public {
    // Setup
    TestRecipient recipient = new TestRecipient();
    streamEscrow.setETHRecipient(address(recipient));
    
    // Fund contract
    (bool success,) = address(streamEscrow).call{value: 1 ether}("");
    require(success);
    
    // This will revert instead of falling back to WETH
    streamEscrow.sendETHToTreasury(1 ether);
}
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
function sendETHToTreasury(uint256 amount) internal {
    if (amount > 0) {
        // Try direct ETH transfer first
        (bool sent,) = ethRecipient.call{value: amount}("");
        
        // If ETH transfer fails, wrap to WETH and transfer
        if (!sent) {
            IWETH(WETH).deposit{value: amount}();
            IERC20(WETH).transfer(ethRecipient, amount);
            emit ETHStreamedToDAOAsWETH(amount);
        } else {
            emit ETHStreamedToDAO(amount);
        }
    }
}
```
