# There is Potential loss of funds if `msg.value` is greater than `ethStreamedPerTick` on `StreamEscrow::forwardAll` or ` StreamEscrow::forwardAllAndCreateStream`

### PoC and Impact

On [StreamEscrow::forwardAll](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L144) if a user sent ETH more than `ethStreamedPerTick`, it got stuck and user loss funds.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Forwards all pending ETH streams if at least `minimumTickDuration` seconds has passed since last forward.
     * @dev This function silently returns if called before `minimumTickDuration` have elapsed since last forward.
     */
    function forwardAll() public {
        // silently fail if at least a day hasn't passed. this is in order not to revert auction house.
        if (block.timestamp < lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration) {
            return;
        }

        lastForwardTimestamp = toUint48(block.timestamp);

@>      sendETHToTreasury(ethStreamedPerTick);

        (uint32 newTick, uint128 ethPerTickEnded) = increaseTicksAndFinishStreams();

        emit StreamsForwarded(newTick, ethPerTickEnded, ethStreamedPerTick, lastForwardTimestamp);
    }
```

[StreamEscrow::sendETHToTreasury](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L303C1-L309C6)

```solidity
    function sendETHToTreasury(uint256 amount) internal {
        if (amount > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = ethRecipient.call{ value: amount }('');
            require(sent, 'failed to send eth');
            emit ETHStreamedToDAO(amount);
        }
    }
```

### Mitigation

We recommend adding a `require` statement to check that `msg.value` is not more than needed.
Or refund the existing ETH based on calculation.

Like, on [StreamEscrow::forwardAllAndCreateStream](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L89C1-L100C6) both `forwardAll` and `createStream` sent ETH.
Calculate their `exact amount` and take the `amount` from the user or `refund` the `existing ETH`.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Forwards all streams and creates a new stream for a Noun.
     * @notice ETH value must be sent with this function call.
     * @dev Combines forwardAll() and createStream() operations into a single transaction.
     * @param nounId The ID of the Noun token for which the stream is being created.
     * @param streamLengthInTicks The duration of the stream in ticks. `minimumTickDuration` must pass for a tick to increase.
     */
    function forwardAllAndCreateStream(uint256 nounId, uint16 streamLengthInTicks) external payable {
        forwardAll();

        createStream(nounId, streamLengthInTicks);
    }
```

If it is called by a high-level function first, like called on NounsAuctionHouseV3 or NounsAuctionHouseV2 then we can implement `refund logic` or check `msg.value` on this function.
Like on [NounsAuctionHouseV3::_settleAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L340C1-L344C10) `streamEscrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream` and `streamEscrow.forwardAll()` is called.

```solidity
/**
     * @notice Settle an auction, finalizing the bid and paying out to the owner.
1>   *   Part of the winning bid amount is sent immediately to the owner, and the rest is streamed via `streamEscrow`.
     * @dev If there are no bids, the Noun is burned.
     */
    function _settleAuction() internal {
        INounsAuctionHouseV3.AuctionV2 memory _auction = auctionStorage;

        require(_auction.startTime != 0, "Auction hasn't begun");
        require(!_auction.settled, 'Auction has already been settled');
        require(block.timestamp >= _auction.endTime, "Auction hasn't completed");

        auctionStorage.settled = true;
        uint256 amountToSendTreasury = (_auction.amount * immediateTreasuryBPs) / 10_000;
        uint256 amountToStream = _auction.amount - amountToSendTreasury;

        if (amountToSendTreasury > 0) {
            _safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), amountToSendTreasury);
        }

        if (amountToStream > 0) {
2>          streamEscrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream{ value: amountToStream }(_auction.nounId, streamLengthInTicks);
        } else {
3>          streamEscrow.forwardAll();
        }

        if (_auction.bidder == address(0)) {
            nouns.burn(_auction.nounId);
        } else {
            nouns.transferFrom(address(this), _auction.bidder, _auction.nounId);
        }

        SettlementState storage settlementState = settlementHistory[_auction.nounId];
        settlementState.blockTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
        settlementState.amount = ethPriceToUint64(_auction.amount);
        settlementState.winner = _auction.bidder;
        if (_auction.clientId > 0) settlementState.clientId = _auction.clientId;

        emit AuctionSettled(_auction.nounId, _auction.bidder, _auction.amount);
        if (_auction.clientId > 0) emit AuctionSettledWithClientId(_auction.nounId, _auction.clientId);
    }
```

Here on the comment it is saying `Part of the winning bid amount is sent immediately to the owner, and the rest is streamed via streamEscrow.`
But the `streamEscrow` only streams the amount of `ethStreamedPerTick` not the whole `msg.vlaue`. ref: [StreamEscrow::forwardAll](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L144)

So not implementing `check` or `refund logic` causes a `potential loss of funds` for the user.
