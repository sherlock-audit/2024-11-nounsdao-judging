# Streaming can be effectively disabled for all the new sales by parameter manipulation

### Summary

Minority protection isn't guaranteed by parameter management logic as `_streamLengthInTicks` can be set to very low value. E.g. setting it to `1` is allowed, keeps the logic fully operational and causes the whole streaming value to be sent over to treasury on the next tick, i.e. after `minimumTickDuration` passes once. Setting `immediateTreasuryBPs == 10_000` also disables all the new streaming and is allowed

### Root Cause

Stream length can be updated, while setting `streamLengthInTicks` to a very low value essentially negates streaming:

```solidity
    function setStreamEscrowParams(
        address _streamEscrow,
        uint16 _immediateTreasuryBPs,
        uint16 _streamLengthInTicks
    ) external onlyOwner {
        streamEscrow = IStreamEscrow(_streamEscrow);
        emit StreamEscrowUpdated(_streamEscrow);

        setImmediateTreasuryBPs(_immediateTreasuryBPs);
>>      setStreamLengthInTicks(_streamLengthInTicks);
    }
```

[NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L287-L291](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/794903316961911a90ab5493ca66592ccbdbd036/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L287-L291)

```solidity
    function setStreamLengthInTicks(uint16 _streamLengthInTicks) public onlyOwner {
>>      require(_streamLengthInTicks > 0, 'streamLengthInTicks too low');
>>      streamLengthInTicks = _streamLengthInTicks;
        emit StreamLengthInTicksUpdated(_streamLengthInTicks);
    }
```

Also, setting `immediateTreasuryBPs` to `10_000` or any high enough value nearby is allowed and similarly negates streaming logic:

[NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L277-L281](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/794903316961911a90ab5493ca66592ccbdbd036/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L277-L281)

```solidity
    function setImmediateTreasuryBPs(uint16 _immediateTreasuryBPs) public onlyOwner {
>>      require(_immediateTreasuryBPs <= 10_000, 'immediateTreasuryBPs too high');
        immediateTreasuryBPs = _immediateTreasuryBPs;
        emit ImmediateTreasuryBPsUpdated(_immediateTreasuryBPs);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Rent seeking majority wins over the DAO, passes the proposal to disable streaming via parameters

### External pre-conditions

None, new parameters can be set via proposal

### Attack Path

DAO sets parameters fully disabling streaming

### Impact

All new sold nouns' owners will not have minority protection

### PoC

DAO majority passes and executes a proposal fully removing streaming for all the subsequent noun sales by setting `streamLengthInTicks` low (to `1`) or `immediateTreasuryBPs` high (to `10_000`)

### Mitigation

As parameters can be reset by a majority vote there is no real minority protection until there a hard coded boundary values.

Consider introducing a material maximum for `immediateTreasuryBPs`, e.g. `30%`:

[NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L277-L281](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/794903316961911a90ab5493ca66592ccbdbd036/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L277-L281)

```diff
    function setImmediateTreasuryBPs(uint16 _immediateTreasuryBPs) public onlyOwner {
-       require(_immediateTreasuryBPs <= 10_000, 'immediateTreasuryBPs too high');
+       require(_immediateTreasuryBPs <= 3_000, 'immediateTreasuryBPs too high');
        immediateTreasuryBPs = _immediateTreasuryBPs;
        emit ImmediateTreasuryBPsUpdated(_immediateTreasuryBPs);
    }
```

However, due to AuctionHouse and StreamEscrow integration introduced there might be the need to disable StreamEscrow call from AuctionHouse for a while, as described in an another issue, for which either outright switch is needed or `10_000` setting should be allowed particularly for this purpose.


Consider making `streamLengthInTicks` immutable or introducing a material minimum for it, e.g. `6 months`:

```diff
    function setStreamLengthInTicks(uint16 _streamLengthInTicks) public onlyOwner {
-       require(_streamLengthInTicks > 0, 'streamLengthInTicks too low');
+       require(_streamLengthInTicks > 182, 'streamLengthInTicks too low');
        streamLengthInTicks = _streamLengthInTicks;
        emit StreamLengthInTicksUpdated(_streamLengthInTicks);
    }
```
