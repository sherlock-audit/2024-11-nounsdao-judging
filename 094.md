# Malicious actor can pass any `clientId` using the `createBid()` function disrupting rewards

### Summary

The [`NounsAuctionHouseV3::createBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L145) is used to create a bid along with a `clientId`.
```solidity
function createBid(uint256 nounId, uint32 clientId) public payable override {
```
The problem is, it allows anyone to pass any `clientId` of their choice, this is typically used for the `Rewards.sol` contract, where malicious actor can pass a `clientId` that is not even registered, and later claim rewards for the same by registering himself.

### Root Cause

In [`NounsAuctionHouseV3:145`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L145), there's no check of a valid `clientId` being passed
```solidity
function createBid(uint256 nounId, uint32 clientId) public payable override { <@ - // Missing check of what kind of clientId is passed
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A malicious actor creates a winning bid with a `clientId` which is not registered or invalid.

### Impact

1. This actor can grief rewards by later registering himself as client and claim rewards.
2. Corrupt data by passing a `clientId` which is too large than ongoing, which is not registered + greater than `maxClientId`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to add checks from `Rewards.sol` contract to ensure a valid clientId is being used.
