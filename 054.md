# Fund Management Transparency Issue in DAO Protocol

### Summary

The Nouns DAO protocol's `StreamEscrow` contract has the `sendETHToTreasury()` [This](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L303) function, which transfers all ETH to the `ethRecipient` address using the `createStream()` and `forwardAll()` functions. However, there is no clear mechanism or transparency regarding how these funds are used or distributed after being sent to the `ethRecipient`.
