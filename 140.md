# Silent Failure of `WETH` Transfer During Auction Settlement

## Vulnerability Details

According to the readme, protocol is to be deployed on `ethereum` and uses `WETH`:
> On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
  Ethereum

>  If you are integrating tokens, are you allowing only whitelisted tokens to work with the codebase or any complying with the standard? Are they assumed to have certain properties, e.g. be non-reentrant? Are there any types of weird tokens you want to integrate?
Nouns DAO basically only uses ETH, WETH, and USDC. We hold stETH, but do not have code that directly interacts with it.

`_settleAuction` function finalizes the auction and handles the transfer of `ETH` or `WETH` to the auction `owner`. 
```js
function _settleAuction() internal {
        INounsAuctionHouseV2.AuctionV2 memory _auction = auctionStorage;

        require(_auction.startTime != 0, "Auction hasn't begun");
        require(!_auction.settled, 'Auction has already been settled');
        require(block.timestamp >= _auction.endTime, "Auction hasn't completed");

        auctionStorage.settled = true;

        if (_auction.bidder == address(0)) {
            nouns.burn(_auction.nounId);
        } else {    
            nouns.transferFrom(address(this), _auction.bidder, _auction.nounId);
        }

        if (_auction.amount > 0) {
@>          _safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), _auction.amount);
        }

        ...snip...
    }
```
If an `ETH` transfer fails, the fallback mechanism wraps the `ETH` into `WETH` and calls `IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount)`.
[NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L304-L309](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L304-L309)
```js
function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    if (!_safeTransferETH(to, amount)) {
        IWETH(weth).deposit{ value: amount }();
        IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount); // @audit Risk of silent failure here
    }
}
```
The `WETH` transfer function returns a bool to indicate success or failure, but it does not revert on failure.
```js
function transfer(address dst, uint wad) public returns (bool) {
    return transferFrom(msg.sender, dst, wad); 
}
```
__How the Issue Emerges:__
- During auction settlement, if the direct ETH transfer fails (e.g., due to issues with the recipient's address or gas limits), the fallback mechanism is triggered.
- The fallback mechanism attempts to wrap the ETH into WETH and transfer the WETH using the IERC20(weth).transfer function.
- The WETH transfer function returns a bool to indicate whether the transfer was successful, but the _safeTransferETHWithFallback function does not check this return value, resulting in silent failure if the transfer fails.
- This issue leads to a scenario where the auction is marked as settled, but the auction owner does not receive the expected funds.


## Impact
 If the fallback WETH transfer fails silently, the auction owner's funds remain locked in the contract while the auction is marked as settled.


## Recommendation
Use Openzeppelin's `safeTransfer` library
