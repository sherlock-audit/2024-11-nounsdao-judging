# There could be a malicious takeover of NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol and NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol due to missing disableinitializers() in constructor

### Summary

The absence of 'disableinitializers()' in the constructor of NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol and NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol makes the contracts to be initialized by anyone after it has been deployed, an attacker could call the initialize method and pass it whatever values as arguments. 

### Root Cause

This issue is caused due to  _disableInitializers() function from Openzeppelin not being called in the constructor of  NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol and NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol to automatically lock the contracts when they are deployed, allowing the Initialize() function of the contracts to be called by anyone. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L72 and https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L82

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol contract is being deployed but not yet initialized.
2. An attacker calls the Initialize() function and pass whatever values they want as arguments.
3. The attacker passes a contract that calls self-destruct as one of the arguments.
4. The arguments will run in NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol and will erase all the code from the address.

### Impact

The protocol suffers as the attacker who initializes the contract could pass whatever values they want as argument, the could pass a contract as argument that calls selfdestruct, it would be run in context of the contracts and erase all code from their addresses.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `_disableInitializers()` function from Openzeppelin should be called in the constructor of the contracts to automatically lock them when they are deployed, preventing the implementation from being used:

```solidity
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```
