# Underlying implementation contracts left open to initialization by attackers in NounsAuctionHouseV2

## Summary
Proxy implementation contracts along the inheritance chain could be left uninitialized, and vulnerable to initialization by attackers due to missing `_disableInitializers()` call in `NounsAuctionHouseV2` contract.

## Vulnerability Details
According to openzeppelin's documentation and [comment suggestions](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/0df841d2d75352786532e9e26f400efdef78d86e/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L33-L45), an uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker, and this applies to both the proxy and its implementation.

`NounsAuctionHouseV2` inherits the proxy contract `PausableUpgradeable` which makes it vulnerable to uninitialization as it does not disable further initialization of the underlying contracts.

## Impact
Underlying proxy implementation contract takeover by attacker.

## Resolution
Adding the following line to it's constructor prevents initialization of the implementations contract itself, adding extra protection from attackers:

```solidity
    constructor(INounsToken _nouns, address _weth, uint256 _duration) initializer {
        nouns = _nouns;
        weth = _weth;
        duration = _duration; 

        _disableInitializers();                      // @audit-fix: disables implementation initialization
    }
```
