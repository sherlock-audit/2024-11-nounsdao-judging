# Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom

## Summary
Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom
## Vulnerability Details
It is good to add a require statement that checks the return value of token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelin's safeTransfer/safeTranferFrom unless one is sure the given token reverts in case of a failure.
```javascript
nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);
```
```javascript
IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount);
```
## Impact
Silent failures on transfers and affect token accounting in contract.
