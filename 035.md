# Unrestricted Bidding During Paused State

**Vulnerability Details**
Despite the contract implementing a pause functionality, the createBid function lacks the whenNotPaused modifier, allowing users to continue placing bids even when the contract is explicitly paused.

**Impact**
Potential for continued bidding during critical security reviews

**Proof of Concept**
1. Scenario:
Nouns DAO detects a critical vulnerability and activates the pause mechanism to halt auctions.

2. Attack Pathway:
 A malicious actor bypasses the pause mechanism and continues bidding during the paused state by:

    - Submitting bids when auctions shouldn't start.
    - Manipulating auction end times.
    - Circumventing the intended security freeze.
     - Exploitation Steps:

3. Identify the paused contract.
    - Use a pre-funded Ethereum wallet.
    - Programmatically submit bids.
    - Exploit the lack of pause validation to manipulate auctions.

**Recommended Mitigation**
Add the whenNotPaused modifier to both createBid() function overloads

```diff
-      function createBid(uint256 nounId) external payable override  {
+      function createBid(uint256 nounId) external payable override whenNotPaused {
          createBid(nounId, 0);
      }
      
-      function createBid(uint256 nounId, uint32 clientId) public payable override {
+     function createBid(uint256 nounId, uint32 clientId) public payable override whenNotPaused {
          // Existing bid creation logic
      }
```
