# Lack of Emergency Control in Auction House Bidding Functions

### Summary

The absence of the `whenNotPaused` modifier in the `createBid` functions will creates a vulnerability for the auction house as it allows bidding to continue even during emergencies.

### Root Cause

In the `NounsAuctionHouseV3` contract, the `createBid` functions do not implement the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which is essential for pausing critical functions during emergencies.


- In `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol`, the `createBid` functions lack the `whenNotPaused` modifier.

 [(Github to second function)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L145)

```solidity
function createBid(uint256 nounId) external payable override {
    createBid(nounId, 0);
}

/**
 * @notice Create a bid for a Noun, with a given amount.
 * @param nounId id of the Noun to bid on
 * @param clientId the client which facilitates this action
 * @dev This contract only accepts payment in ETH.
 */
function createBid(uint256 nounId, uint32 clientId) public payable override {
    // Function logic here
}
```

### Impact

The auction house suffers a complete loss of control over its bidding functionality. The absence of the `whenNotPaused` modifier allows:
- Bids to be placed during a known vulnerability
- The attacker to exploit the bidding process without any immediate way to halt the activity, resulting in unauthorized manipulation of auction outcomes.
