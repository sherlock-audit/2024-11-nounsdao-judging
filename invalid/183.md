# If Approved Operator Create Stream Then Gas Cost Will Be Increased and Efficiency Will be Decrease

### Summary

If Approved Operator Create Stream Then Gas Cost Will Be Increased and Efficiency Will be Decrease Because `fastForwardStream`  Will  be Not Possible. An Malicious Operator Can Do That.

### Root Cause

Approved Owner Can Create Stream But Can not Fast Forward Stream. If That Situation Happen For Many More Then That Create Problem.

### Internal pre-conditions

If Approved Operator  Call `createStream`  Multiples Times.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Malicious Approved Owner will Create Create Multiple Stream.
2. Now Fast forward of this Streams are not possible.
3. That Will Effect on Efficiency and Gas cost 

### Impact

If Malicious Operator Do This Then Gas Cost Will Increase and Efficiency Will Decrease.

### PoC

Code For Create Stream ....
```
 /**
     * @notice Creates a new ETH stream for a specific Noun token.
   ->  *** @dev Only allowed addresses that are also Noun owners/approved operators can create streams.**
     * @param nounId The ID of the Noun token to create a stream for.
     * @param streamLengthInTicks The duration of the stream in ticks.
     * @custom:throws 'not allowed' if sender is not allowed to create streams.
     * @custom:throws 'only noun owner or approved' if sender is not owner/approved.
     * @custom:throws 'stream active' if a stream already exists for the Noun.
     * @notice ETH value must be sent with this function call.
     */
    function createStream(uint256 nounId, uint16 streamLengthInTicks) public payable {
        require(allowedToCreateStream[msg.sender], 'not allowed');
       @-> require(isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, nounId), 'only noun owner or approved');
        require(!isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream active');
...
}```
Code for Fast forward any Stream 
``` function fastForwardStream(uint256 nounId, uint32 ticksToForward) public {
        require(ticksToForward > 0, 'ticksToForward must be positive');
      @->  require(nounsToken.ownerOf(nounId) == msg.sender, 'not noun owner');
...
}
