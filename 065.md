# Auctions run for less time than intended

### Summary

The `NounsAuctionHouse `contracts calculate auction duration from creation time rather than first bid time, potentially reducing the effective auction period and impacting price discovery. 
code Snippet : 
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L299](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L299)
### Root Cause

When an auction is created, the end time is immediately set based on current timestamp plus duration, regardless of when the first bid occurs. This means if the first bid comes significantly after auction creation, the remaining time for competitive bidding is reduced from the intended duration.
```solidity
function _createAuction() internal {
    try nouns.mint() returns (uint256 nounId) {
        uint40 startTime = uint40(block.timestamp);
        uint40 endTime = startTime + uint40(duration);

        auctionStorage = AuctionV2({
            nounId: uint96(nounId),
            clientId: 0,
            amount: 0,
            startTime: startTime,
            endTime: endTime,
            bidder: payable(0),
            settled: false
        });
    }
}
```
However, when an auction is created in `_createAuction()`, the auction's `startTime` is incorrectly initialized as `uint40(block.timestamp)` instead of `firstBidTime`.
