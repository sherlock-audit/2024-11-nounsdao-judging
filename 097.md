# unsafe use of transferfrom instead of safetransferfrom

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L349
the settleauction function uses transferfrom to transfer the nft from the contract to the auctionbidder, using transferFrom does not check whether the recipient (the bidder) is capable of handling ERC721 tokens. If _auction.bidder is a contract that does not implement the onERC721Received function, the transfer will succeed, but the token may become "stuck" in that contract, potentially leading to loss of the token

        if (_auction.bidder == address(0)) {
            nouns.burn(_auction.nounId);
        } else {
@>            nouns.transferFrom(address(this), _auction.bidder, _auction.nounId);
        }
