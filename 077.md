# Out-of-Gas DoS in NounsAuctionHouseV2

## Summary
The `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` function in NounsAuctionHouseV2 is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack through gas manipulation, potentially forcing the contract into a paused state and disrupting the auction system.

## Root Cause
The vulnerability stems from insufficient gas handling in the `_createAuction` function, where any error during the minting process triggers a contract pause without distinguishing between out-of-gas errors and legitimate failures.

## Internal pre-conditions
- Contract must be in an unpaused state
- Current auction must be ready for settlement


## External pre-conditions
- Attacker needs enough ETH to pay for transaction gas
- Timing requirement: Must be executed when current auction is ready for settlement

## Attack Path
1. Wait for an auction to reach settlement time
2. Calculate minimum gas needed to reach `nouns.mint()`
3. Call `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` with precisely limited gas:
```solidity
function executeAttack() external {
    uint256 gasLimit = calculateMinGas();  // Just enough to reach mint()
    (bool success,) = address(auctionHouse).call{gas: gasLimit}(
        abi.encodeWithSignature("settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()")
    );
}
```
4. Gas exhaustion during mint causes catch block execution
5. Contract enters paused state

## Impact
1. **Protocol Operation Disruption**:
   - Auctions can be repeatedly forced into pause state
   - Requires DAO governance action to unpause
   - Disrupts daily auction schedule

2. **Economic Impact**:
   - Lost revenue during paused periods
   - Reduced protocol activity
   - Potential loss of user confidence

3. **Governance Implications**:
   - Frequent governance interventions required
   - Time delays in resuming operations
   - Resource drain on DAO



## Mitigation
1. Add gas requirement check:
```solidity
function _createAuction() internal {
    uint256 requiredGas = 750_000;  // Safe gas estimate
    require(gasleft() >= requiredGas, "Insufficient gas");
    
    try nouns.mint() returns (uint256 nounId) {
        // ... existing auction creation code ...
    } catch Error(string memory reason) {
        if (!isOutOfGasError(reason)) {
            _pause();
        }
        revert(reason);
    }
}
```

2. Alternative approach:
   - Separate settlement and creation into two transactions
   - Implement gas-efficient minting process
   - Add specific error handling for OOG conditions
