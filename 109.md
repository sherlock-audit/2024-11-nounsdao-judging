# Time Buffer Manipulation Risk


## Summary
The contract owner can change the time buffer setting while auctions are running. This means they can unfairly change how long bidders have to place counter-bids during an auction, which could be used to favor certain bidders.

## Root Cause
The `setTimeBuffer` function doesn't check if an auction is active before allowing changes. This means the owner can change this important auction rule at any time.

## Reference
- [Contract code: `setTimeBuffer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L227)

## Proof of Concept
The owner can change the time buffer in two ways that hurt the auction:
1. Make it very small to stop auction extensions
2. Make it very large to force auctions to keep going

Here's the problematic code:
```solidity
function setTimeBuffer(uint56 _timeBuffer) external override onlyOwner {
    require(_timeBuffer <= MAX_TIME_BUFFER, 'timeBuffer too large')
    timeBuffer = _timeBuffer;
}
```

## Internal Pre-conditions
- Contract must be working (not paused)
- Someone must have owner access

## External Pre-conditions
- An auction must be running
- The auction should be close to ending for maximum effect

## Attack Path
1. Wait until an auction is almost over
2. Owner changes the time buffer:
   - Makes it tiny to prevent more bids
   - Makes it huge to keep auction going longer
3. This change affects who can win the auction

## Impact
When the owner changes the time buffer during an auction, it breaks the fairness of the bidding process. Bidders can lose money because the rules changed in the middle of the auction, and people will stop trusting the auction system because they can't count on the rules staying the same.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add a check to prevent time buffer changes during active auctions:
```solidity
function setTimeBuffer(uint56 _timeBuffer) external override onlyOwner {
    require(_timeBuffer <= MAX_TIME_BUFFER, 'timeBuffer too large');
    require(auctionStorage.settled || auctionStorage.startTime == 0, 'Auction in progress');
    timeBuffer = _timeBuffer;
    emit AuctionTimeBufferUpdated(_timeBuffer);
}
```
