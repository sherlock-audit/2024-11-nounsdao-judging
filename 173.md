# Any non-minter address can pause the contract causing DOS for sometime (until unpaused by admin)

### Summary

The `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` function allows anyone to settle an active auction and then create a new one. While creating a new auction using `_createAuction` method; it mints a noun for the caller. The function `mint` is present inside `NounsToken.sol` which only allows a minter address to mint a noun. A non-minter address will cause a revert which will be caught by the catch inside `_createAuction()` and then it pauses the contract by calling the internal method `_pause`.

### Root Cause

Reference:  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L315

The root cause is obviously the catch body which calls the internal method `_pause` and pauses the contract. This is an unnecessary headache for the owner as every time some non-minter pauses the contract, the owner has to manually call the `unpause` method. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The caller should not be a valid minter.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The non-minter address calls the `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` function.

### Impact

The protocol will suffer from random arbitrary pauses which will prevent other user to bid on auctions and create auctions too.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the pause from the catch body.
