# Missing `disableinitializers()` in constructor can lead to malicious takeover of the implementation contracts

**Summary**
`disableinitializers` is not called in [NounsAuctionHouseV2's](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L72C5-L76C6) and [NounsAuctionHouseV3's](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L82C5-L86C6) constructors.

**Vulnerability Details**
An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. But in case of the implementation contract, a `disableinitializers()` is necessary to be called in the constructor.
This is because when theNounsAuctionHouseV2 and NounsAuctionHouseV3 contract is deployed and initialized, the initialize method on the newly created NounsAuctionHouseV2 and NounsAuctionHouseV3 proxy's implementation contract is never called. As such, anyone can call that method and pass in whatever values they want as arguments. If an attacker passes in a contract as argument that calls `selfdestruct`, it will be run in the context of the `NounsActionHouse` implementation contract and will erase all code from that address.


**Impact**
An attacker can call `NounsAuctionHouseV2::initialize` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3::initialize`  and pass arbitrary arguments


**Recommended Mitigation**
To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the `_disableInitializers()` function from Openzeppelin in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

- In `NounsAuctionHouseV2` contract:
```diff
      constructor(INounsToken _nouns, address _weth, uint256 _duration) initializer {
+            _disableInitializers();
              nouns = _nouns;
              weth = _weth;
              duration = _duration;
          }
```
- In `NounsAuctionHouseV3` contract: 
```diff
     constructor(INounsToken _nouns, address _weth, uint256 _duration) initializer {
+      _disableInitializers();
        nouns = _nouns;
        weth = _weth;
        duration = _duration;
      
    }
```
