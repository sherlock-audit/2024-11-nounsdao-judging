# bidder will lose funds and ETH can be locked by bidding after auction settlement

### Summary

Lack of strict timestamp validation in auction settlement will cause loss of bidder funds as bidders can place bids after auction is settled, resulting in trapped ETH in the contract.

### Root Cause

 In `NounsAuctionHouseV3`.sol, the timestamp checks allow both settlement and bidding at` block.timestamp = _auction.endTime:` 
```solidity
require(block.timestamp >= _auction.endTime, "Auction hasn't completed"); // settlement
require(block.timestamp < _auction.endTime, 'Auction expired'); // bidding
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Auction reaches exact `endTime`
2. Settlement function is callable
3. Bidding still possible at `endTime`

-  this is the code Snippet : 

[createBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L145)
[_settleAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L325)

### External pre-conditions

1. Multiple transactions can be included in same block

### Attack Path

1. Auction reaches endTime
2. Settlement transaction executes
3. Bidder submits bid in same block
4. ETH from bid becomes trapped in contract

### Impact

Bidders can lose ETH by placing bids which make Funds become permanently locked in the contract.
