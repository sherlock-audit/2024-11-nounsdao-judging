# Limited `minBidIncrementPercentage` in `NounsAuctionHouseV2` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3` contracts

### Summary

The `NounsAuctionHouseV2` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3` contracts have a limitation on the maximum bid increment percentage due to the use of `uint8` for the `minBidIncrementPercentage` variable. This restricts the maximum allowable increase in bids to 255%, limiting auction flexibility. 

The `NounsAuctionHouseV2::setMinBidIncrementPercentage` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3::setMinBidIncrementPercentage`  functions allow setting the minimum bid increment percentage. However, the `minBidIncrementPercentage` variable is defined as `uint8`, which can only store values between 0 and 255. This means that the max minimum percentage difference between the last bid amount and the current bid that can be set is 255 (current bid max = last bid amount * 2.55).

### Root Cause

In [`NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol:64`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L64) the `minBidIncrementPercentage` is defined as uint8

In [`NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol:65`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L65) the `minBidIncrementPercentage` is defined as uint8

### Vulnerability
```solidity
@> uint8 public minBidIncrementPercentage;

@> function setMinBidIncrementPercentage(uint8 _minBidIncrementPercentage) external override onlyOwner {
        require(_minBidIncrementPercentage > 0, 'must be greater than zero');

        minBidIncrementPercentage = _minBidIncrementPercentage;

        emit AuctionMinBidIncrementPercentageUpdated(_minBidIncrementPercentage);
    }
```

### Impact

When a value greater than 255 is passed to `setMinBidIncrementPercentage`, it causes the function to revert. This means that the max minimum percentage difference between the last bid amount and the current bid that can be set is 2.55. So the max value that can be set for the current bid is last bid amount * 2.55. If the owner wants to set a greater amount (for example: current bid = last bid amount * 3.50) this isn't possible because he/she needs to pass 350 in the `setMinBidIncrementPercentage`. This restricts the owner functionality that for special cases would like to increase this parameter and can't, limiting the protocol flexibility. 

### Mitigation

Consider using a larger integer type (e.g., uint16) for `minBidIncrementPercentage`.
