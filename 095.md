# Precision loss was not accounted for in `StreamEscrow::cancelStream` function causing stream creator to receive lesser refunds

### Summary

When streams are created with an uneven division of `msg.value` by `streamLengthInTicks`, the leftover remainder is sent to the treasury in `createStream`, but this remainder is not accounted for when calculating refunds in cancelStream. This leads to lesser refund amount being sent to the stream creator.

In `createStream` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L112C5-L130C6), `ethPerTick` was calculated thus: `uint128 ethPerTick = toUint128(msg.value / streamLengthInTicks);`
The possible precision loss above was accounted for thus: 
```js
   uint256 remainder = msg.value % streamLengthInTicks;
   sendETHToTreasury(remainder);
```


```js
function createStream(uint256 nounId, uint16 streamLengthInTicks) public payable {
        require(allowedToCreateStream[msg.sender], 'not allowed');
        require(isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, nounId), 'only noun owner or approved');
        require(!isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream active');

        // register new stream
@>        uint128 ethPerTick = toUint128(msg.value / streamLengthInTicks);
        uint32 streamLastTick = currentTick + streamLengthInTicks;
        ethStreamEndingAtTick[streamLastTick] += ethPerTick;

        // the remainder is immediately streamed to the DAO
@>        uint256 remainder = msg.value % streamLengthInTicks;
        sendETHToTreasury(remainder);

        uint128 newEthStreamedPerTick = ethStreamedPerTick + ethPerTick;
        ethStreamedPerTick = newEthStreamedPerTick;
        streams[nounId] = Stream({ ethPerTick: ethPerTick, canceled: false, lastTick: streamLastTick });
        emit StreamCreated(nounId, msg.value, streamLengthInTicks, ethPerTick, newEthStreamedPerTick, streamLastTick);
    }
```

The bug occurs in the `cancelStream` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L167C5-L186C6). 

When a stream creator calls `cancelStream`, the amount to refund to them is calculated without accounting for the possible remainder that occured when creating stream. 
`uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;` 


### Root Cause

In `createStream`:

ETH is divided evenly over the `streamLengthInTicks`:
```js
    uint128 ethPerTick = toUint128(msg.value / streamLengthInTicks);
```
The remainder was sent to the treasury:
```js
   uint256 remainder = msg.value % streamLengthInTicks;
   sendETHToTreasury(remainder);
```

However, in `cancelStream`:
The refund calculation does not account for the remainder that was sent to the treasury:
```js
    uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;
```
This calculation assumes the entire `msg.value` was distributed across ticks, leading to an under-refund.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Financial Loss: Stream owners may receive less ETH than expected when canceling a stream, due to the untracked remainder sent to the treasury.


### PoC

Assume stream creator called `createStream` with `15 ETH`  and `streamLengthInTicks` is 6. 

`ethPerTick = 15 / 6 = 2`
`remainder = 3`

The creator calls `cancelStream` after 3 ticks, refund is calculated as: 
`uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;`
`amountToRefund = 2 * 3 = 6 ETH`

Calculation without precision loss
`ethPerTick = (15 * 10 ** 18) / 6 = 25e17`

Amount to Refund after 3 ticks:
`amountToRefund = 25e17 * 3 = 75e17` ie 7.5 ETH

In this case the stream creator loses 1.5 ETH when they cancel their stream. 

### Mitigation

Consider refactoring the `ethPerTick` calculation:
```diff
function createStream(uint256 nounId, uint16 streamLengthInTicks) public payable {
        require(allowedToCreateStream[msg.sender], 'not allowed');
        require(isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, nounId), 'only noun owner or approved');
        require(!isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream active');

        // register new stream
-        uint128 ethPerTick = toUint128(msg.value / streamLengthInTicks);
+       uint128 ethPerTick = toUint128((msg.value * 10 ** 18) / streamLengthInTicks);
        uint32 streamLastTick = currentTick + streamLengthInTicks;
        ethStreamEndingAtTick[streamLastTick] += ethPerTick;

        // the remainder is immediately streamed to the DAO
-        uint256 remainder = msg.value % streamLengthInTicks;
-        sendETHToTreasury(remainder);

        uint128 newEthStreamedPerTick = ethStreamedPerTick + ethPerTick;
        ethStreamedPerTick = newEthStreamedPerTick;
        streams[nounId] = Stream({ ethPerTick: ethPerTick, canceled: false, lastTick: streamLastTick });
        emit StreamCreated(nounId, msg.value, streamLengthInTicks, ethPerTick, newEthStreamedPerTick, streamLastTick);
    }
```
