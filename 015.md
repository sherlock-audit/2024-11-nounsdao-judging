# Lack of similar data types in `NounsAuctionHouseV2::createBid()` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3::createBid()` will permanently break the auction bidding functionality for all users when `block.timestamp` exceeds the maximum value of `uint40` (approximately 34 years)

### Summary

The lack of similar data types in the function `createBid()` in [NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L145) and in [NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L129) will cause the require statement 

```solidity
require(block.timestamp < _auction.endTime, 'Auction expired');
```
to permanently fail when `block.timestamp` is legitimately greater than `_auction.endTime`. This is due to a type mismatch between `block.timestamp` (which is always `uint256`) and the auction's endTime (which is defined as a `uint40`), causing all bid attempts to revert when the timestamp exceeds the maximum value of `uint40` which is ~34 years.

### Root Cause

[`_auction.endTime`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/interfaces/INounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L34) in `INounsAuctionHouseV3.sol` and in [`INounsAuctionHouseV2.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/interfaces/INounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L34) is a `uint40` digit meant to indicate the time that an auction is scheduled to end. Each NFT auction ends at a different time, i.e noun 1's auction ended at a different time that noun 30's auction. `block.timestamp` will always be a `uint256` digit. 

For that matter, `_auction.endTime` has to be adjusted for every new Noun NFT to reflect the time when that NFT auction will end. It will reach a time in the future when `block.timestamp` will be greater than `_auction.endTime` as `block.timestamp` increases with every new block added to the blockchain. Consider an NFT in the future whose `_auction.endTime` is `type(uint40).max` and the `block.timestamp` is `type(uint40).max + 100`. The problem is that the require statement in [#L155](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L155) in `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol` and also in [#L139](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L139) in `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol` will fail cause `block.timestamp` will be greater than `_auction.endTime`.

```solidity
require(block.timestamp < _auction.endTime, 'Auction expired');
```

This means the contract breaks for every single person as no one can create a bid and consequently no bids can be settled rendering the protocol useless for everyone.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- The ethereum blockchain has progressed to a block timestamp greater than `type(uint40).max`, i.e ~34 years.

### Attack Path

- Wait for ethereum's blockchain timestamp to exceed `type(uint40).max` which is approximately 34 years.
- Attempt to create a bid by calling [`NounsAuctionHouseV2::createBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L129) or [`NounsAuctionHouseV3::createBid()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L145) for an NFT whose scheduled time to end is `type(uint40.max)`.
- The transaction will consistently revert due to timestamp comparison, i.e 
`require(block.timestamp < _auction.endTime, 'Auction expired');` will always fail.

### Impact

- Complete denial of service for the Nouns DAO auction mechanism.
- Permanent inability to create auctions.
- The protocol becomes unusable for everyone.
- Breaks the One Noun, Every Day, Forever mantra of the Nouns DAO as NFT bidding creation will stop after `type(uint40).max` (approximately 34 years).

### Mitigation

1. Change `_auction.endTime` to use a `uint256` data type, i.e change to the following in [INounsAuctionHouseV2.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/interfaces/INounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L24-L39) and in [INounsAuctionHouseV3.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/interfaces/INounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L24-L39)

```solidity
    struct AuctionV2 {
        // ID for the Noun (ERC721 token ID)
        uint96 nounId;
        // ID of the client that facilitated the latest bid, used for client rewards
        uint32 clientId;
        // The current highest bid amount
        uint128 amount;
        // The time that the auction started
        uint40 startTime;
        // The time that the auction is scheduled to end
        uint256 endTime;    /// @audit-tag change from uint40 to uint256
        // The address of the current highest bid
        address payable bidder;
        // Whether or not the auction has been settled
        bool settled;
    }
```

2. Or constrain `block.timestamp` to a `uint40` in the require statement, i.e

```solidity
require(uint40(block.timestamp) < _auction.endTime, 'Auction expired');
```
