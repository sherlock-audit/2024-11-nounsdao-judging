# Hardcoded gas limit in _safeTransferETH will lack of flexibility to adapt to various scenarios

### Summary

A hardcoded gas limit of 30,000 in ETH transfers will lack of flexibility to  adapt to various scenarios.

### Root Cause

```solidity
function _safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 value) internal returns (bool) {
    bool success;
    assembly {
        success := call(30000, to, value, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    }
    return success;
}
```
In NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol:_safeTransferETH() the hardcoded gas limit of 30,000 for ETH transfers


### Internal pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

A hardcoded gas limit of 30,000 in ETH transfers will lack of flexibility to  adapt to various scenarios including:
1. Network upgrades that modify gas costs
2. Future protocol integrations with different gas requirements
and so on...

While the WETH fallback prevents complete failure, it:
1. Forces unwanted token conversion
2. May break contract integrations expecting ETH

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add configurable gas limit:
```solidity
uint256 public transferGasLimit = 30000;

function setTransferGasLimit(uint256 _gasLimit) external onlyOwner {
    transferGasLimit = _gasLimit;
    emit TransferGasLimitUpdated(_gasLimit);
}

function _safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 value) internal returns (bool) {
    bool success;
    assembly {
        success := call(transferGasLimit, to, value, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    }
    return success;
}
```
