# The `try/catch` block does not catch any errors related to a Panic exception or custom revert.

### Summary

In the `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol` contract, a `try/catch` block is used when creating an auction to handle potential reverts during the minting process. However, the implementation utilizes `catch Error(string memory)`, which only catches reverts with a string error message. This approach does not handle other types of exceptions, such as `Panic` exceptions or low-level reverts (e.g., `assert` failures or out-of-gas errors), leaving those scenarios unaddressed.

### Root Cause
```solidity
    function _createAuction() internal {
        try nouns.mint() returns (uint256 nounId) {
            uint40 startTime = uint40(block.timestamp);
            uint40 endTime = startTime + uint40(duration);

            auctionStorage = AuctionV2({
                nounId: uint96(nounId),
                clientId: 0,
                amount: 0,
                startTime: startTime,
                endTime: endTime,
                bidder: payable(0),
                settled: false
            });

            emit AuctionCreated(nounId, startTime, endTime);
        } catch Error(string memory) {                                                            <<<@
            _pause();
        }
    }

```

### Impact


Using only `catch Error(string memory)` limits error handling to reverts with string messages, such as `require` failures. This approach misses critical cases like:  

1. **Unhandled Low-Level Reverts**: Reverts triggered by `assert` failures, out-of-gas errors, or direct `revert` statements without a string message are ignored, causing the transaction to fail silently.  

2. **Missed Panic Codes**: Runtime exceptions (e.g., overflow, invalid opcodes) emit `Panic(uint256)` errors, which `catch Error` cannot handle.  

3. **Lost Debugging Context**: Without `catch (bytes memory lowLevelData)`, raw revert data is inaccessible, reducing the ability to diagnose unexpected issues.  

**Why It Matters**:  
Comprehensive error handling ensures robustness and clarity. Adding `catch (bytes memory lowLevelData)` provides a fallback for all reverts, allowing for better diagnostics and recovery strategies in edge cases.  


### PoC

[Guardian Audits](https://solodit.cyfrin.io/issues/global-2-delay-limit-success-guardian-audits-none-gmx-markdown) also reported the same issue.

## Error Types in Solidity
1. `catch Error(string memory reason)`

  - Catches reverts that include an error message string.
  - Example of a revert it can catch:
```solidity
revert("Some error occurred");
```

2. `catch (bytes memory lowLevelData)`

- Catches all revert scenarios, including those without a string message, custom errors, or low-level errors.
 - Example of a revert it can catch:
 ```solidity
revert(); // No message
revert CustomError(); // Using custom errors
```

 - If you're only using catch Error(string memory), reverts without a string or using custom errors will not be handled.


### Mitigation

Utilize `catch (bytes memory lowLevelData)` to catch Panic exceptions and custom reverts.
