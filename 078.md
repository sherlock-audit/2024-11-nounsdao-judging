# Flaw in Auction Extension Logic Reduces Effective Auction Duration During Competitive Bidding


### Summary
The `createBid` function in NounsAuctionHouseV2 contains a  flaw in its auction extension logic where the auction end time is extended from the current block timestamp instead of the current auction end time, potentially leading to shorter auction durations during competitive bidding periods.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L129

### Root Cause
The issue stems from this line in the `createBid` function:
```solidity
auctionStorage.endTime = _auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + _timeBuffer);
```
Instead of extending from the current `endTime`, it extends from `block.timestamp`, which can significantly reduce the auction duration during active bidding periods.

### Internal pre-conditions
- An auction must be active
- A bid must be placed within the `timeBuffer` period of the auction end
- Multiple bidders must be participating near the auction end

### External pre-conditions
- No external conditions required
- Normal network operation is sufficient

### Attack Path
1. Initial auction is running with endTime = T
2. Bidder A places bid at T - timeBuffer
3. Auction extends to: block.timestamp + timeBuffer (instead of T + timeBuffer)
4. Bidder B places bid shortly after
5. Each subsequent bid extends from current time, not previous endTime
6. Results in progressively shorter extension periods

### Impact
- Economic impact:
  - Shorter effective auction durations during competitive bidding
  - Reduced time for counter-bids
  - Potentially lower final sale prices
  - Decreased protocol revenue
  - Suboptimal price discovery
- Operational impact:
  - Unfair advantage to faster bidders
  - Reduced competition in final moments


### Mitigation
Change the auction extension logic to:
```diff
function createBid(uint256 nounId, uint32 clientId) public payable override {
    INounsAuctionHouseV2.AuctionV2 memory _auction = auctionStorage;

    (uint192 _reservePrice, uint56 _timeBuffer, uint8 _minBidIncrementPercentage) = (
        reservePrice,
        timeBuffer,
        minBidIncrementPercentage
    );

    require(_auction.nounId == nounId, 'Noun not up for auction');
    require(block.timestamp < _auction.endTime, 'Auction expired');
    require(msg.value >= _reservePrice, 'Must send at least reservePrice');
    require(
        msg.value >= _auction.amount + ((_auction.amount * _minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
        'Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount'
    );

    auctionStorage.clientId = clientId;
    auctionStorage.amount = uint128(msg.value);
    auctionStorage.bidder = payable(msg.sender);

    // Extend the auction if the bid was received within `timeBuffer` of the auction end time
    bool extended = _auction.endTime - block.timestamp < _timeBuffer;

    emit AuctionBid(_auction.nounId, msg.sender, msg.value, extended);
    if (clientId > 0) emit AuctionBidWithClientId(_auction.nounId, msg.value, clientId);

    if (extended) {
-        auctionStorage.endTime = _auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + _timeBuffer);
+        auctionStorage.endTime = _auction.endTime = uint40(_auction.endTime + _timeBuffer);
        emit AuctionExtended(_auction.nounId, _auction.endTime);
    }

    address payable lastBidder = _auction.bidder;

    // Refund the last bidder, if applicable
    if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
        _safeTransferETHWithFallback(lastBidder, _auction.amount);
    }
}
```
This ensures the auction is extended from its current end time rather than the current block timestamp.
