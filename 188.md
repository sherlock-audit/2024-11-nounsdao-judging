# Not using nonReentrant modifer, although inherited from ReentrancyGuardUpgradable allows reentrancy.

### Summary

The contract [NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L43) inherits OZ's ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable but does not use the nonReentrant modifer that comes with it. Since [external calls](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L181) are always done to the auction's last bidder, this opens up opportunities to re-enter into the contract. Although the [safeTransferETH()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L376) limits the gas usage to 30000, this could stay leads to read-only reentrancy in external contracts utilizing the Auction House.

### Root Cause

nonReentrant modifer is inherited but not used in functions.

### Internal pre-conditions

A malicious contract has to enter the auction.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.A malicious contract enters the auction.
2.When another users enter, the auction house calls to the malicious contract with last bidding value.
3.Malicious contract reenters into the contract.

### Impact

Although reentrancy is possible, it is not clear what an attacker can achieve by it. Nevertheless, nonReentrant modifier should be added to functions, since it is clear that the developers inherited the ReentrancyGuardUpgradable to disable reentrancy.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add nonReentrant modifers to functions.
