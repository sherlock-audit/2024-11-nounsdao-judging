# In function `_createAuction`  `try` `catch` is not working properly

### Summary

In the `_createAuction` function of the `NounsAuctionHouseV3` contract https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L299-L318, the `try-catch` mechanism is ineffective. Specifically, when `try nouns.mint() returns (uint256 nounId)` reverts, the execution does not enter the `catch` block. This issue arises because the `nouns.mint()` call directly interacts with the target contract and does not use a trusted wrapper contract to handle potential failures properly. As a result, the contract fails to pause when expected, leaving it in a broken state.  

A similar issue was previously reported: [sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance-judging#178](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-04-teller-finance-judging/issues/178).  

### Root Cause
The root cause lies in the `_createAuction` function, where the `try-catch` block is implemented incorrectly. Specifically, the `try` block relies on `nouns.mint()` to return a value, but if `nouns.mint()` reverts, the execution fails to enter the `catch` block.  

This occurs because the `try` statement directly interacts with an external contract (`nouns`) without using a wrapper contract that can properly isolate and forward reverts to the `catch` block.  

```solidity
try nouns.mint() returns (uint256 nounId) {
    // Successful mint logic
} catch {
    // This block is never entered when mint() reverts
    _pause();
    return;
}
```


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `_createAuction` function is invoked (e.g., through `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction`).  
2. The `nouns.mint()` call fails or reverts due to a bug, gas constraints, or other runtime issues.

### External pre-conditions

 External factors such as insufficient gas or reversion conditions in the `nouns.mint()` function trigger a revert.

### Attack Path

While this issue is not directly exploitable for malicious gain, it leads to a failure in core functionality:  
1. The owner calls `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` to unpause the contract and create a new auction.  
2. The `_createAuction` function invokes `nouns.mint()`.  
3. `nouns.mint()` reverts, but the `catch` block is never executed.  
4. The `_pause()` function is not triggered, leaving the contract in an inconsistent or paused state.  

### Impact

When Owner tries to `unpause` the contract and the `createAuction` function reverts because try is not used properly the contract remains paused.
Core contract functionality broken

```solidity
function settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction() external override whenNotPaused {
        _settleAuction();
        _createAuction();
    }
```
when this function reverts because of try catch bug it will not pause the contract 

The `try` `catch` mechanism is not working in function  `_createAuction()` and it will never go in the catch.

User Trust and DAO Integrity: Participants lose trust in the system due to the contract's inability to handle errors gracefully.  


### PoC

The issue can be demonstrated by simulating a scenario where `nouns.mint()` reverts. For instance:  
1. Deploy the contract and ensure `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` is callable.  
2. Cause `nouns.mint()` to fail (e.g., by triggering a runtime error or deploying a dummy contract for testing that always reverts).  
3. Observe that the `catch` block in `_createAuction` is not executed and `_pause()` is not called.  

Test Case Example:  
```solidity
function test_createAuction_revert() public {
    // Deploy a mock Nouns contract that always reverts on mint
    MockNouns mockNouns = new MockNouns();
    auctionHouse.setNounsContract(address(mockNouns));

    // Attempt to settle and create a new auction
    vm.expectRevert("AuctionHouse: failed to mint");
    auctionHouse.settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction();
    
    // Verify that the contract is still paused
    assertTrue(auctionHouse.paused());
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Use a Wrapper Contract: 
   Create a trusted wrapper contract for the `nouns.mint()` call. The wrapper should handle failures and propagate them as expected to trigger the `catch` block.  
   ```solidity
   try wrapper.mint() returns (uint256 nounId) {
       // Mint successful
   } catch {
       // Enter catch block on revert
       _pause();
   }
   ```

2. Handle Reverts Explicitly:  
   Ensure that `nouns.mint()` emits specific revert reasons that can be detected and handled appropriately in the contract logic.  

3. Validate Contract State Before Minting:  
   Perform checks before calling `nouns.mint()` to reduce the likelihood of runtime errors.
