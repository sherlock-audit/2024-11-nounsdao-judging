# Absence of Mechanism to Enforce Timely Execution of Tick Advancements in StreamsEscrow

### Summary

The `StreamsEscrow` contract relies on the timely execution of the `forwardAll` or `forwardAllAndCreateStream` functions to advance ticks and transfer ETH to recipients. However, no mechanism enforces or incentivizes regular execution, leading to potential mismanagement of funds, disruptions in recipient payouts, and protocol inefficiencies. This creates a vulnerability that could allow ETH accumulation in the escrow without regular streaming, adversely impacting user trust and protocol utility.

### Root Cause

The absence of:

* A mechanism to enforce the timely execution of `forwardAll` or `forwardAllAndCreateStream`.
* Incentives for users or external entities to call these functions regularly.
* While `minimumTickDuration` ensures that ticks cannot advance too quickly, there is no `maxTickDuration` or enforcement mechanism to guarantee ticks progress in a timely manner.


### Internal pre-conditions

* The `StreamsEscrow` contract has ETH stored for streaming to recipients.
* The `forwardAll` and `forwardAllAndCreateStream` functions are callable by external entities.
* The tick advancement logic relies on manual or contract-triggered function calls.

### External pre-conditions

* Users or other contracts, such as `NounsAuctionHouseV3`, are expected to call `forwardAll` or `forwardAllAndCreateStream`.
* No enforcement or automation ensures calls happen at regular intervals.

### Attack Path
 
* A malicious or negligent actor holds the Nouns NFT but chooses not to call `forwardAll` as there is no incentive or obligation to do so or the `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol` is paused due to some reason so`forwardAllAndCreateStream` is not called.
* As a result:
  * Ticks are not advanced.
  * ETH meant for streaming remains locked in the escrow contract.
* This disrupts recipient payouts and accumulates funds within the contract, rendering the protocol ineffective.


### Impact

* ETH streaming to recipients halts, damaging user trust in the protocol. 
* This can lead to delays in ETH transfers to the recipient (ethRecipient), disrupting the intended continuous funding model.
* Funds accumulate in escrow, reducing operational efficiency.
* Potential for the protocol to lose value as users disengage due to unreliable payouts.

### PoC

This is the `forwardAll` function: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L136-L149

```Solidity
    function forwardAll() public {
        // silently fail if at least a day hasn't passed. this is in order not to revert auction house.
        if (block.timestamp < lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration) {
            return;
        }

        lastForwardTimestamp = toUint48(block.timestamp);

        sendETHToTreasury(ethStreamedPerTick);

        (uint32 newTick, uint128 ethPerTickEnded) = increaseTicksAndFinishStreams();

        emit StreamsForwarded(newTick, ethPerTickEnded, ethStreamedPerTick, lastForwardTimestamp);
    }
```

This is the `forwardAllAndCreateStream` function: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L96-L100

```Solidity
    function forwardAllAndCreateStream(uint256 nounId, uint16 streamLengthInTicks) external payable {
        forwardAll();

        createStream(nounId, streamLengthInTicks);
    }

```

* A malicious or negligent actor holds the Nouns NFT but chooses not to call `forwardAll` as there is no incentive or obligation to do so or the `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol` is paused due to some reason so `forwardAllAndCreateStream` is not called.
* As a result:
   * Ticks are not advanced.
   * ETH meant for streaming remains locked in the escrow contract.
* This disrupts recipient payouts and accumulates funds within the contract, rendering the protocol ineffective

### Mitigation

* Deploy a decentralized automation service (e.g., Chainlink Keepers, Gelato) to monitor and call the `forwardAll` function regularly.
* Ensure calls happen at intervals defined by `minimumTickDuration`.
