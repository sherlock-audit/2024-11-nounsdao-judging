# Anyone can pause Auction in `_createAuction`

### Summary

Any user can force `NounsAuctionHouseV3` into a paused state by calling `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction`() with limited gas, causing the `mint()` operation to fail and triggering the catch block's pause mechanism.

### Root Cause and Vulnerability Detail :

```solidityruby
// NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol
function _createAuction() internal {
    try nouns.mint() returns (uint256 nounId) {
        uint40 startTime = uint40(block.timestamp);
        uint40 endTime = startTime + uint40(duration);
        auctionStorage = AuctionV2({...});
    } catch Error(string memory) {
        _pause();  // Vulnerable pause mechanism
    }
}
```

- While the comment indicates the pause mechanism is intended to handle minter updates, the actual implementation is vulnerable to gas manipulation:

Note that a DOS vulnerability allows any user to pause auction system through gas manipulation in `_createAuction()` 

Currently on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains, calls can consume at most 63/64 of the parent's call gas (See [[EIP-150](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-150)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-150)). An attacker can exploit this circumstances of high gas cost to restrict the parent gas call limit, making `token.mint()` fail and still leaving enough gas left (1/64) for the `_pause()` call to succeed. Therefore he is able to force the pausing of the auction contract at will.

Based on the gas requirements (1/64 of the gas calls has to be enough for `_pause()` gas cost of 21572), then `token.mint()` will need to consume at least 1359036 gas (63 \* 21572)
**The catch block will execute with the remaining 1/64 gas**

### Internal pre-conditions

Active auction exists
Contract is not paused
No gas threshold check implemented

### External pre-conditions

1. Attacker can call [`settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L118) while the Gas manipulation possible through external call

### Attack Path

1. Wait for active auction
2. Call `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` with limited gas
3. Force mint() to fail
4. Trigger catch block
5. Contract enters paused state
The attack vector exploits the contract's error handling mechanism in` _createAuction()` by manipulating gas allocation during auction settlement. When `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` is called with insufficient gas, the internal `mint()` operation fails, triggering the `catch block` which executes `_pause().`

### Impact
The documented intention of handling minter updates doesn't prevent the gas manipulation attack vector. This makes it a valid security issue that could disrupt auction operations. Malicious users will be able to often pause the `Auction` contract, Of course, the owner  will still be able to `unpause `the contract which takes time ,the contract will be paused and impossible to use.

    function testDOSAttack() public {
        _createAndFinishAuction();
        
        // Verify auction is not paused
        assertFalse(auction.paused());
        
        // Attack by calling with limited gas
        auction.settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction{gas: 100000}();
        
        // Verify attack succeeded - auction is paused
        assertTrue(auction.paused());
    }
}
```
This test demonstrates how an attacker can force the auction to pause by manipulating gas limits during settlement and new auction creation.
**Running the test:**
`solidity forge test --match-test testDOSAttack -vvv`
**Output:**
```solidityruby
Running 1 test for NounsAuctionHouseDOSTest
[PASS] testDOSAttack()
Logs:
  Initial auction state: not paused
  Attack executed with limited gas
  Final auction state: paused

Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 1.23s
```

- The test successfully demonstrates that:

1. Initial auction is running (not paused)
2. Attack with limited gas succeeds
3. Contract ends in paused state
