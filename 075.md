# Missing fund tracking will prevent accurate stream management for the DAO

### Summary

The `StreamEscrow` contract is responsible for managing multiple streams, tracking their associated funds, and streaming ETH to the DAO.

(search keyword: `Stream management`)
However, the current implementation of the `Stream` struct and `streams` mapping is insufficient to meet the documented requirements. Specifically:
1. The `Stream` struct contains only `ethPerTick`, `canceled`, and `lastTick` fields.
2. These fields do not provide the ability to track:
   - Total funds deposited for a specific stream.
   - The remaining balance for a stream after periodic streaming to the DAO.

As a result, the contract cannot accurately determine **"how many funds belong to which stream"** and **"how much has already been streamed to the DAO"** as stated in the documentation.

### Root Cause

The issue lies in the lack of necessary fields in the `Stream` struct:
1. The `Stream` struct tracks:
   - `ethPerTick`: ETH streamed per tick.
   - `lastTick`: The tick when the stream ends.
   - `canceled`: Whether the stream is active.
2. Missing fields:
   - **Total Deposited Funds**: The total amount of ETH deposited for a stream.
   - **Streamed Amount**: The amount of ETH already streamed to the DAO.
   - **Remaining Balance**: Funds remaining for future ticks.

The absence of these fields makes it impossible to reconcile or validate the state of individual streams.

### Impact

1. **Inability to Track Stream Balances**:
   - The contract lacks the ability to calculate the exact remaining balance of funds for any given stream.

2. **Ambiguity in Funds Accounting**:
   - Without proper accounting, the DAO or stream creators cannot validate whether the funds were managed correctly or verify how much of the stream has been consumed.

3. **Non-Compliance with Documentation**:
   - The contract does not fulfill the documented requirement of managing stream funds with precise internal accounting.

### Mitigation

1. **Enhance the `Stream` Struct**:
   Add fields to track the total deposited funds, streamed amount, and remaining balance:
   ```solidity
   struct Stream {
       uint128 ethPerTick;
       uint128 totalDeposited;  // Total ETH deposited for this stream
       uint128 streamedAmount;  // Amount of ETH already streamed
       uint32 lastTick;
       bool canceled;
   }
   ```

2. **Update Stream Management Logic**:
   - When a stream is created, initialize `totalDeposited` and `streamedAmount`:
   ```solidity
   streams[nounId] = Stream({
       ethPerTick: ethPerTick,
       totalDeposited: msg.value,
       streamedAmount: 0,
       lastTick: streamLastTick,
       canceled: false
   });
   ```

   - During streaming (e.g., in `forwardAll`), update `streamedAmount` and calculate remaining balance:
   ```solidity
   stream.streamedAmount += ethPerTick * ticksStreamed;
   uint128 remainingBalance = stream.totalDeposited - stream.streamedAmount;
   ```
