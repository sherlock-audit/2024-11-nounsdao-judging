# Auction Cancellation by Attacker

# Auction Cancellation by Attacker.

### Summary
An attacker can cancel the auction without losing any funds.

### Root Cause
In the StreamEscrow::cancelStream() function, the canceler can recover all of their funds.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L167

### Internal pre-conditions
NounsAuctionHouseV3::immediateTreasuryBPs = 0

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
When immediateTreasuryBPs = 0, the attacker can acquire the noun at a higher price than any other participant. The attacker calls NounsAuctionHouseV3::settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction() on time and then immediately invokes StreamEscrow::cancelStream() to recover all of the funds.

### Impact
No nouns can be auctioned.

### PoC

```solidity
NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol
325:    function _settleAuction() internal {
            [...]
333:        uint256 amountToSendTreasury = (_auction.amount * immediateTreasuryBPs) / 10_000;
            uint256 amountToStream = _auction.amount - amountToSendTreasury;

            if (amountToSendTreasury > 0) {
                _safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), amountToSendTreasury);
            }

            if (amountToStream > 0) {
                streamEscrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream{ value: amountToStream }(_auction.nounId, streamLengthInTicks);
            } else {
                streamEscrow.forwardAll();
            }
            [...]
        }
```
Here, amountToSendTreasury = 0;

```solidity
StreamEscrow.sol
167:    function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
            require(isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream not active');

            // transfer noun to treasury
            nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);

            // cancel stream
            streams[nounId].canceled = true;
            Stream memory stream = streams[nounId];
            ethStreamedPerTick -= stream.ethPerTick;
            ethStreamEndingAtTick[stream.lastTick] -= stream.ethPerTick;

            // calculate how much needs to be refunded
180:        uint256 ticksLeft = stream.lastTick - currentTick;
            uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;
            (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amountToRefund }('');
            require(sent, 'failed to send eth');

            emit StreamCanceled(nounId, amountToRefund, ethStreamedPerTick);
        }
```
Since cancelStream() is called immediately after createStream() is called, currentTick doesn't increase, allowing the attacker to recover all the funds.

### Mitigation

```solidity
StreamEscrow.sol
167:    function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
            require(isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream not active');

            // transfer noun to treasury
            nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);

            // cancel stream
            streams[nounId].canceled = true;
            Stream memory stream = streams[nounId];
-           ethStreamedPerTick -= stream.ethPerTick;
            ethStreamEndingAtTick[stream.lastTick] -= stream.ethPerTick;
+           ethStreamEndingAtTick[currentTick + 1] += stream.ethPerTick;

            // calculate how much needs to be refunded
-           uint256 ticksLeft = stream.lastTick - currentTick;
+           uint256 ticksLeft = stream.lastTick - currentTick - 1;
            uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;
            (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amountToRefund }('');
            require(sent, 'failed to send eth');

            emit StreamCanceled(nounId, amountToRefund, ethStreamedPerTick);
        }
```
