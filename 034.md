# An attacker can completely DoS stream logic and severely harm DAO treasury by repeatedly canceling early

### Summary

Providing full refund in case of stream canceling in `StreamEscrow.sol` will cause a significant loss of intended ETH streaming to the DAO treasury as an attacker will win Noun auctions and immediately cancel streams to reclaim 80% of their winning bid ETH and DoS the stream escrow logic by repeatedly doing this.

### Root Cause

Allowing stream cancellation with full remaining ETH refund is a mistake as it allows attackers to manipulate the intended streaming mechanism while only losing the immediate DAO treasury payment portion (`immediateTreasuryBPs`, 20%, from README).
Since there is no penalty mechanism, after winning an auction, an attacker can basically cancel a stream after the first tick, effectively blocks 99.99% of the stream amount. Attacker can repeat this attack everyday to completely DoS the streaming.

```solidity
uint256 amountToSendTreasury = (_auction.amount * immediateTreasuryBPs) / 10_000;
uint256 amountToStream = _auction.amount - amountToSendTreasury;
```

```solidity
function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
        require(isStreamActive(nounId), "stream not active");

        // transfer noun to treasury
        nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);

        // cancel stream
        streams[nounId].canceled = true;
        Stream memory stream = streams[nounId];
        ethStreamedPerTick -= stream.ethPerTick;
        ethStreamEndingAtTick[stream.lastTick] -= stream.ethPerTick;

        // calculate how much needs to be refunded
        uint256 ticksLeft = stream.lastTick - currentTick;
        uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;
        (bool sent,) = msg.sender.call{value: amountToRefund}("");
        require(sent, "failed to send eth");

        emit StreamCanceled(nounId, amountToRefund, ethStreamedPerTick);
    }
```

- Key points of this issue

1. Providing full refund without penalty makes this attack vector sustainable. Attacker can cancel the stream after just streaming 1 tick, and got the full refund.
2. It's easy. Attacker just needs to win auctions and cancel streams after first tick repeatedly.
3. Cheap. (Cost = Noun NFT * 20% * days) is very low amount to completely DOS streams of Nouns. Attacker doesn't even need to be a whale.

### Internal pre-conditions


### External pre-conditions

1. Attacker to win auctions
2. Attacker to cancel streams

### Attack Path

1. Attacker wins a Noun auction for 2.4 ETH (Nouns NFTs were auctioned for 2.4 ETH for the last 10 days averagely) 
Please check Nouns website https://nouns.wtf/
2. Auction settles:
     0.48 ETH (20%) goes directly to DAO treasury
     1.92 ETH (80%) goes to stream escrow with `streamLengthInTicks` = 1460 (4 years, can't be modified, from README 
     https://mirror.xyz/verbsteam.eth/jFi5T0aehwZws7Q6jdRn8xZmORu25TiyWz4G5LAHuaU)

3. `ethPerTick` = 1.92 ETH / 1460 â‰ˆ 0.0013 ETH
4. Attacker immediately calls `cancelStream`() after first tick
5. Attacker receives full refund of ~1.9186 ETH (original streamed amount minus one tick)
6. Attacker repeats this attack everyday and does not let any of the streams to continue.

From the README mirror link (https://mirror.xyz/verbsteam.eth/jFi5T0aehwZws7Q6jdRn8xZmORu25TiyWz4G5LAHuaU) :
"We are contemplating changing how auction winners pay for their Noun: **instead of paying the full amount to the DAO right away**, a small part would be paid to the DAO upon settlement". 

So previously the full amount was being transferred to the DAO. 

Let's do a quick calculation. Assume that attacker executes this attack for 30 days, 1 auction settles per day:

As stated at 1st point, we will use 2.4 ETH per NFT averagely. 

- Scenario 1 (previous system)
2.4 ETH * 30 days = 72 ETH/month --> 72 ETH transferred directly to DAO treasury right after the auctions.

- Scenario 2 (stream escrow, attacked)
0.48 ETH * 30 days = 14.4 ETH/month --> 14.4 + 0.04 ETH (30x `ethPerTick`) transferred directly to DAO treasury right after the auctions and the first tick cancels. 
**Also the remaining 57.5 ETH is **NOT** going to be streamed, because attacker has cancelled all streams and got the full refund.**

- Scenario 1 vs Scenario 2: Attacker effectively cut the streams which supposed to be streamed to DAO treasury, completely DoSed the streaming logic by not letting any of the streams to continue. 
1 month of attack impact in long term: 57.5 ETH loss

This is a very easy attack for an attacker wants to manipulate Nouns DAO. 

Attacker only spent 14.44 ETH/month and completely DoSed the streaming logic and dropped the Nouns DAO treasury reserves by 80%.

### Impact

Complete DoS of stream escrow
DAO treasury reserves down by 80% in the long term

### PoC

Described in the Attack Path

### Mitigation

- The solution I recommend to this is to **apply penalties** as many other streaming/vesting platforms do, and do not allow users to cancel streams until some point.
- Even if initial payment percentage can be modified by DAO proposal, attack vector will be still valid and executable.
