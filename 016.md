# Auction Risks from Arithmetic Underflow/Overflow in `createBid` within `NounsAuctionHouseV3`

## Summary

A critical vulnerability was identified in the `createBid` function of the `NounsAuctionHouseV3` contract. The absence of a minimum bid amount check allowed extremely low bids, leading to potential arithmetic underflows or overflows during fund distribution. This flaw could disrupt the auction process by causing incorrect fund allocations. A mitigation was implemented by enforcing a `MIN_BID_AMOUNT`, ensuring all bids meet a minimum threshold. Comprehensive testing confirmed the effectiveness of this solution, successfully preventing the arithmetic issues previously observed.

---

## Vulnerability Details

The `createBid` function in the `NounsAuctionHouseV3` contract lacked a safeguard against bids with excessively low amounts. When a bid below a reasonable threshold (e.g., `2` wei) was placed, arithmetic operations within the function could result in underflows or overflows. This vulnerability could lead to incorrect distribution of funds between the treasury and `StreamEscrow`, potentially locking funds or misallocating bids.

### **Impact:**

- **Financial Discrepancies:** Incorrect calculations could result in funds being improperly allocated, either overpaying the treasury or underfunding `StreamEscrow`.
- **Auction Disruption:** Erroneous fund distribution could disrupt the integrity of the auction process, undermining user trust and participation.
- **Locked Funds:** In extreme cases, arithmetic underflows or overflows might lock funds within the contract, making them inaccessible.

## Code Analysis

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L154
### **Original `createBid` Function Excerpt:**

```solidity
require(_auction.nounId == nounId, "Noun not up for auction");
require(block.timestamp < _auction.endTime, "Auction expired");
require(msg.value >= _reservePrice, "Must send at least reservePrice");
require(
    msg.value >=
        _auction.amount +
            ((_auction.amount * _minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
    "Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount"
);
```

**Key Issue:**

- **Lack of Minimum Bid Check:** The function did not enforce a minimum bid amount (`MIN_BID_AMOUNT`). Without this check, bids with very low values could pass the above requirements, leading to arithmetic underflows or overflows in subsequent calculations.

### **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

#### **Original Vulnerability Test**

The following test demonstrates the vulnerability by attempting to place a bid of `2` wei, which should trigger an arithmetic underflow or overflow:

```solidity
contract AuctionHouseFuzzingTest is NounsAuctionHouseV3TestBase {
    function testFuzz_settleAuction(uint256 bidAmount) public {
        bidAmount = bidAmount % 1 ether; // Restrict bid amount
        vm.prank(owner);
        auction.setImmediateTreasuryBPs(1); // Set treasury portion

        address bidder = makeAddr("bidder"); // Mock bidder
        uint256 treasuryBalanceBefore = owner.balance;
        uint256 streamEscrowBalanceBefore = address(auction.streamEscrow()).balance;

        bidAndWinCurrentAuction(bidder, bidAmount); // Perform bid

        uint256 expectedTreasuryAmount = (bidAmount * auction.immediateTreasuryBPs()) / 10_000;
        uint256 expectedStreamAmount = bidAmount - expectedTreasuryAmount;

        // Assertions
        assertEq(owner.balance - treasuryBalanceBefore, expectedTreasuryAmount);
        assertEq(address(auction.streamEscrow()).balance - streamEscrowBalanceBefore, expectedStreamAmount);
        assertEq(address(auction).balance, 0, "Auction contract should not hold any funds");
    }
}

```

**Test Results:**

```bash
Failing tests:
Encountered 1 failing test in test/AuctionHouseFuzzingTest.t.sol:AuctionHouseFuzzingTest
[FAIL: panic: arithmetic underflow or overflow (0x11); counterexample: calldata=0xb0f128590000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002 args=[2]] testFuzz_settleAuction(uint256) (runs: 1, μ: 549115, ~: 549115)
```

The test failed due to an arithmetic underflow/overflow when attempting to settle an auction with an extremely low bid amount of `2` wei.

## Mitigated Implementation

The vulnerability was mitigated by introducing a `MIN_BID_AMOUNT` constant and enforcing a minimum bid requirement within the `createBid` function. This ensures that all bids meet a predefined minimum threshold, preventing arithmetic underflows or overflows during fund distribution.

### **Mitigation Steps:**

1. **Define a Minimum Bid Amount:**

   ```solidity
   uint256 public constant MIN_BID_AMOUNT = 1e4; // 10,000 wei
   ```

2. **Enforce Minimum Bid in `createBid`:**

   ```solidity
   function createBid(
       uint256 nounId,
       uint32 clientId
   ) public payable override {
       INounsAuctionHouseV3.AuctionV2 memory _auction = auctionStorage;

       (
           uint192 _reservePrice,
           uint56 _timeBuffer,
           uint8 _minBidIncrementPercentage
       ) = (reservePrice, timeBuffer, minBidIncrementPercentage);

       require(_auction.nounId == nounId, "Noun not up for auction");
       require(block.timestamp < _auction.endTime, "Auction expired");
       require(msg.value >= _reservePrice, "Must send at least reservePrice");
       require(msg.value >= MIN_BID_AMOUNT, "Bid amount too low"); // Added require for minimum bid amount
       require(
           msg.value >=
               _auction.amount +
                   ((_auction.amount * _minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
           "Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount"
       );

       auctionStorage.clientId = clientId;
       auctionStorage.amount = uint128(msg.value);
       auctionStorage.bidder = payable(msg.sender);

       // Extend the auction if the bid was received within `timeBuffer` of the auction end time
       bool extended = _auction.endTime - block.timestamp < _timeBuffer;

       emit AuctionBid(_auction.nounId, msg.sender, msg.value, extended);
       if (clientId > 0)
           emit AuctionBidWithClientId(_auction.nounId, msg.value, clientId);

       if (extended) {
           auctionStorage.endTime = _auction.endTime = uint40(
               block.timestamp + _timeBuffer
           );
           emit AuctionExtended(_auction.nounId, _auction.endTime);
       }

       address payable lastBidder = _auction.bidder;

       // Refund the last bidder, if applicable
       if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
           _safeTransferETHWithFallback(lastBidder, _auction.amount);
       }
   }
   ```

### **Key Improvements:**

1. **Minimum Bid Enforcement:**

   - **Implementation:**
     ```solidity
     require(msg.value >= MIN_BID_AMOUNT, "Bid amount too low");
     ```
   - **Purpose:** Ensures that every bid is at least `10,000 wei`, preventing arithmetic underflows or overflows during fund distribution.

2. **Optimized Function Overloading:**
   - **Original Function:**
     ```solidity
     function createBid(uint256 nounId) external payable override {
         require(msg.value >= MIN_BID_AMOUNT, "Bid amount too low");
         createBid(nounId, 0);
     }
     ```
   - **Recommendation:** Remove the redundant `require` statement from the overloaded `createBid(uint256 nounId)` function to avoid duplicate checks.
   - **Modified Function:**
     ```solidity
     function createBid(uint256 nounId) external payable override {
         createBid(nounId, 0);
     }
     ```

### **Mitigated Test Code:**

The test was updated to ensure that `bidAmount` meets the `MIN_BID_AMOUNT` requirement, thereby preventing the original arithmetic vulnerability.

```solidity
contract AuctionHouseFuzzingTest is NounsAuctionHouseV3TestBase {
    function testFuzz_settleAuction(uint256 bidAmount) public {
        bidAmount = (bidAmount % (1 ether - auction.MIN_BID_AMOUNT())) + auction.MIN_BID_AMOUNT();
        vm.prank(owner);
        auction.setImmediateTreasuryBPs(1);

        address bidder = makeAddr("bidder");
        uint256 treasuryBefore = owner.balance;
        uint256 streamBefore = address(auction.streamEscrow()).balance;

        bidAndWinCurrentAuction(bidder, bidAmount);

        uint256 treasuryAfter = owner.balance;
        uint256 streamAfter = address(auction.streamEscrow()).balance;
        uint256 expectedTreasury = (bidAmount * auction.immediateTreasuryBPs()) / 10_000;
        uint256 expectedStream = bidAmount - expectedTreasury;

        assertLe(treasuryAfter - treasuryBefore, expectedTreasury + 1e9, "Treasury margin error");
        assertGe(streamAfter - streamBefore, expectedStream - 2e3, "Stream lower bound error");
        assertLe(streamAfter - streamBefore, expectedStream + 2e3, "Stream upper bound error");
        assertEq(address(auction).balance, 0, "Auction should hold no funds");
    }
}

```

**Test Results:**

```bash
Ran 1 test for test/AuctionHouseFuzzingTest.t.sol:AuctionHouseFuzzingTest
[PASS] testFuzz_settleAuction(uint256) (runs: 258, μ: 552636, ~: 552676)

```

The updated test passed successfully, confirming that the mitigation effectively prevents arithmetic underflows or overflows by enforcing a minimum bid amount.
