# On ` StreamEscrow::createStream` there is Potential loss of funds if `msg.value` is greater than need

### Summary

The [StreamEscrow::createStream](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L122C1-L124C38) is sending ETH based on `remainder = msg.value % streamLengthInTicks`.

It also calculate `uint128 ethPerTick = toUint128(msg.value / streamLengthInTicks)`. Now if the user sends ETH greater than needed then it will be stuck and potential loss of funds for the user.


### PoC

On [StreamEscrow::createStream](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L112C1-L130C6) we can see based on the calculation how much `msg.value` is actually needed.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Creates a new ETH stream for a specific Noun token.
     * @dev Only allowed addresses that are also Noun owners/approved operators can create streams.
     * @param nounId The ID of the Noun token to create a stream for.
     * @param streamLengthInTicks The duration of the stream in ticks.
     * @custom:throws 'not allowed' if sender is not allowed to create streams.
     * @custom:throws 'only noun owner or approved' if sender is not owner/approved.
     * @custom:throws 'stream active' if a stream already exists for the Noun.
     * @notice ETH value must be sent with this function call.
     */
    function createStream(uint256 nounId, uint16 streamLengthInTicks) public payable { 
        require(allowedToCreateStream[msg.sender], 'not allowed');
        require(isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, nounId), 'only noun owner or approved');
        require(!isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream active');

        // register new stream
1>      uint128 ethPerTick = toUint128(msg.value / streamLengthInTicks);
        uint32 streamLastTick = currentTick + streamLengthInTicks;
        ethStreamEndingAtTick[streamLastTick] += ethPerTick;

        // the remainder is immediately streamed to the DAO
2>      uint256 remainder = msg.value % streamLengthInTicks;
        sendETHToTreasury(remainder);

        uint128 newEthStreamedPerTick = ethStreamedPerTick + ethPerTick;
        ethStreamedPerTick = newEthStreamedPerTick;
        streams[nounId] = Stream({ ethPerTick: ethPerTick, canceled: false, lastTick: streamLastTick });
3>      emit StreamCreated(nounId, msg.value, streamLengthInTicks, ethPerTick, newEthStreamedPerTick, streamLastTick);
    }
```

We can see it emits an event with `StreamCreated` and passes `msg.value`. 
But `msg.value` sent by the user is never tracked which proves that if the user sent ETH more than needed got stuck.

[StreamEscrow::sendETHToTreasury](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L303C1-L309C6)

```solidity
    function sendETHToTreasury(uint256 amount) internal {
        if (amount > 0) {
            (bool sent, ) = ethRecipient.call{ value: amount }('');
            require(sent, 'failed to send eth');
            emit ETHStreamedToDAO(amount);
        }
    }
```

### Mitigation

We recommend adding a `require` statement to check that `msg.value` is not more than needed.
Or refund the existing ETH based on calculation.
