# 1 out of 10 auction will revert

### Summary

When minting NFTs, every 1 out of 10 NFTs up to ID 1820 will be a special Nounder NFT. Currently we are on 1332, which can be checked using [their site](https://nouns.wtf/).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsToken.sol#L149-L154
```solidity
    function mint() public override onlyMinter returns (uint256) {
        if (_currentNounId <= 1820 && _currentNounId % 10 == 0) {
            _mintTo(noundersDAO, _currentNounId++);
        }
        // minter refers to auction house
        return _mintTo(minter, _currentNounId++);
    }
```

The issue that occurs here is that `NounsAuctionHouseV3` makes auctions for every NFT, and upon settling those auctions it tries to transfer the NFT away to the winner.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L346-L350
```solidity
        if (_auction.bidder == address(0)) {
            nouns.burn(_auction.nounId);
        } else {
            nouns.transferFrom(address(this), _auction.bidder, _auction.nounId);
        }
```

However 1 out 10 NFTs will not be minted into the auction house and when it tries to settle the auction the function would revert causing the contract to be bricked, or the least temporary DOS.

### Root Cause

Not handling the special NFTs

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Contract cannot make any more auctions as `_settleAuction` reverts every time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider skipping auctions for these NFTs
