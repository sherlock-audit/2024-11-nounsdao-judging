# Users will not have access to the stream feature when interacting with the proxy as the upgrade did not occur on the mainnet

### Summary

The doc(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gxLSkRQooJtcqMm3I86cOJpsnaObwEE5ergqkSl87kM/edit?usp=sharing) states the following:
_The mainnet upgrade_

_The high-level steps to starting using streams on mainnet are:_

_[verbs team wallet] Deploy the StreamEscrow contract._
_[verbs team wallet] Deploy the new auction house logic (NounsAuctionHouseV3)._
_[via DAO proposal] Upgrade auction house & set the stream escrow parameters._
However, as we can see in the `ProposeUpgradeAHV3.s.sol` script:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/script/StreamEscrow/ProposeUpgradeAHV3.s.sol#L16 
The last step (_[via DAO proposal] Upgrade auction house & set the stream escrow parameters._) is only performed on the sepolia testnet, not on the mainnet.

### Root Cause

Doc/code discrepancy in the following script: `ProposeUpgradeAHV3.s.sol`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Upgrade auction house & set the stream escrow parameters is not performed on Mainnet. Users will still be using the V2 when interacting with the proxy on the mainnet.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make sure you upgrade auction house & set the stream escrow parameters on Mainnet.
