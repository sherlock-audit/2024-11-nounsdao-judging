# An auction may never end

### Summary

When creating a bid in NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol (or V2.sol) there is a check which will extend then auction's end time by a time buffer. Thus any user can continue adding bids, and each time a bid is added the auction end time is incremented by the time buffer.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the fact that this extending of auction can be done indefinitely. 

### Internal pre-conditions

There are no preconditions.

### External pre-conditions

There are no external preconditions

### Attack Path

1. Assume that there is a noun up for auction and there are no bids till now for it. (also assume time buffer = 1 minute , and minbidincrementpercentage = 100% : for simplicity).
2. Bob creates a bid for 1 wei when there is 30 seconds left. This causes the auction endTime to get incremented by 1 minute(since bob put up a bid 30 seconds before close and timebuffer = 1min)
3. After another 1 min, when there is 30 seconds left, Bob puts another bid for 2 wei (100 % increase), which will again increase the auction end time by 1 min.
4. This can be done by Bob indefinitely (obviously limited by the money Bob has). Each time Bob creates a new bid, his previous bid is returned to him, so Bob can possibly use a flash loan to continue creating such bids indefinitely.
5. In the example provided by me bob can increase the auction time 60 times (at which point the bid amount = 1ether). Which corresponds to 1 hour delay of an auction

### Impact

1. There could be an auction which never ends which will break the protocols functionality of an auction every 24 hours.
2. The malicious attacker can delay the winning bid's money being sent to the owner for a period of time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

There are multiple ways to mitigate this issue:
1. Limit the extension number to 1 (extend the auction only once)
2. Keep a minimum amount to bid (this will dis incentivize attackers simply bidding 1 wei to extend).
