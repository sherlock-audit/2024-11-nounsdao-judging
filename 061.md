# Selling and buying nounce NFTs from marketplaces would be dangerous, thanks to the new mechanic

### Summary

After the winner is selected, 20% of the bid goes strait to the DAO, and the rest is set to be streamed daily for up to 4 years. The final bidder, who receives the NFT can choose to `cancelStream` and refund all of the un-streamed ETH. This essentially means that NFTs would have some intrinsic value in ETH.

However when these NFTs are traded in different marketplaces, the user who owns the NFT would be able to manipulate and grief it's buyer by abusing `fastForwardStream`.

Example:

1. User bids 10 ETH and wins the bid, 2 ETH is set directly to auction and 8 is streamed over 4 years
2. After some time he decides to sell the NFT, while the NFT holds 7 ETH that are to be streamed
3. There are a few bids. highest one is 7.1 ETH (7 ETH for the inherit value and 0.1 for the value of the NFT)
4. He accepts the bid, but before that calls `fastForwardStream` to forward all 6.9 ETH (leaving very little to be streamed)

The seller receives 7.1 ETH and the buyer an NFT which would have been able to redeem for 7 ETH, but now only worth 0.1 (or less)

### Root Cause

Users being able to change the value of an NFT, i.e. `fastForwardStream`
