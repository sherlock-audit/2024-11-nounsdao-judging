# Helper contract allowed to create streams can block auctioning

### Summary

Griefing vector can be possible: if a contract/EOA, let's call it `AnotherStreamer`, with `allowedToCreateStream` privileges besides `AuctionHouse` be introduced in the future, and it also be `nounsToken.isApprovedForAll(AuctionHouse, AnotherStreamer)` in order to facilitate stream creation for all newly minted nouns, then `AnotherStreamer` can block the stream creation by `AuctionHouse` via running `createStream()` of its own with any dust value as long as current auction has any positive bid. This can be done only once to block all the auctions as without the ability to create stream the current auction will not be settleable

### Root Cause

Each auctioned noun is minted during `_settleAuction()` (which is called with via `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` or on unpausing):

[NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L299-L300](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/794903316961911a90ab5493ca66592ccbdbd036/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L299-L300)

```solidity
    function _createAuction() internal {
>>      try nouns.mint() returns (uint256 nounId) {
```

After that blocking is possible since only one stream is allowed per time with no stacking and there is no minimum amount for the stream creation:

[StreamEscrow.sol#L112-L118](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/794903316961911a90ab5493ca66592ccbdbd036/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L112-L118)

```solidity
    function createStream(uint256 nounId, uint16 streamLengthInTicks) public payable {
>>      require(allowedToCreateStream[msg.sender], 'not allowed');
>>      require(isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, nounId), 'only noun owner or approved');
>>      require(!isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream active');

        // register new stream
        uint128 ethPerTick = toUint128(msg.value / streamLengthInTicks);
```

Calling `createStream()` for an auctioned noun outside auction house, e.g. by `AnotherStreamer`, will effectively block auctioning of all the new nouns until `immediateTreasuryBPs` be set to `10_000` to disable the streaming (and `allowedToCreateStream` or `isApprovedForAll` privileges be removed from `AnotherStreamer` to remove next day attack possibility) since until that `amountToStream > 0` and `streamEscrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream()` call has to end successfully in order for this noun to settle:

[NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L333-L344](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/794903316961911a90ab5493ca66592ccbdbd036/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L333-L344)

```solidity
        uint256 amountToSendTreasury = (_auction.amount * immediateTreasuryBPs) / 10_000;
>>      uint256 amountToStream = _auction.amount - amountToSendTreasury;

        if (amountToSendTreasury > 0) {
            _safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), amountToSendTreasury);
        }

        if (amountToStream > 0) {
            streamEscrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream{ value: amountToStream }(_auction.nounId, streamLengthInTicks);
        } else {
            streamEscrow.forwardAll();
        }
```

As streams can be up to `2^16 - 1` ticks long (`179.5 years` if one tick is one day) so waiting out can't be an option. 

`AnotherStreamer` can be a helper contract according to [Updated spec#Creating a stream](https://mirror.xyz/verbsteam.eth/GYWRLqAC0heMC_2Fhc0ez0Mchxp_MCUIjoyt8UPGwrs):

```md
Additional use cases might include selling treasury-owned Nouns outside the auction mechanism.
In such cases we might create a helper contract that will be allowed,
and the DAO will approve such a helper contract to transfer some or all of its Nouns.
```

I.e. if such helper contract `AnotherStreamer` turns malicious/be hacked on its own then it can block all the new sales via `createStream()` anytime after noun minting, but before auction settlement call, this way denying mandatory new stream creation until streaming disabling and access revoking proposal be executed

### Internal pre-conditions

Some helper `AnotherStreamer` contract or EOA is granted `allowedToCreateStream` and `nounsToken.isApprovedForAll(AuctionHouse, AnotherStreamer)` access. This is feasible as it can be the setup for alternative nouns selling channel

### External pre-conditions

`AnotherStreamer` turns malicious or be hacked, even temporary loss of control is enough since only one `createStream()` call is needed to block auction settlement until the fixing proposal passes through

### Attack Path

`AnotherStreamer` calls `createStream(auctionedId, streamLengthInTicks)` with `streamLengthInTicks = 2^16 - 1`, `msg.value = 1 wei` after current noun was minted in `_createAuction()`. In order to guarantee `amountToStream > 0` attacker can wait for some positive bid in or make one themselves

### Impact

Current auction will be blocked from ending and new ones will not be able to start until `immediateTreasuryBPs` be set to `10_000` to disable the streaming and `allowedToCreateStream` or `isApprovedForAll` privileges be removed from `AnotherStreamer` so it can't repeat the attack. DAO will be deprived from the associated auction revenues for the number of days needed to execute the fixing proposal

### PoC

Malicious `AnotherStreamer` needs to:

1. Wait for the first bid during auction, then
2. Call `streamEscrow.createStream{ value: 1 wei }(_auction.nounId, 2^16 - 1)`
3. After that until the fixing proposal be executed auctioning will be effectively disabled

### Mitigation

Consider providing other entities with only `tokenId` based privileges for the newly distributed nouns. Consider introducing some minimum implied total stream value notification for `StreamEscrow`, so it won't accept lesser amounts in `createStream()`
