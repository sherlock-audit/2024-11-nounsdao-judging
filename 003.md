# vah - Unbounded Loop Vulnerability in `NounsAuctionHouseV2`

### Summary

A vulnerability exists in the `NounsAuctionHouseV2` contract where functions such as `getSettlements`, `warmUpSettlementState`, and `setPrices` process an unbounded number of iterations. This can lead to gas exhaustion when called with large inputs, resulting in denial of service (DoS) and potential disruptions to the contract's operations.



### Root Cause

Location
Contract: [NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L347)
Functions: getSettlements, warmUpSettlementState, setPrices

### Attack Path

1. Deploy malicious contract
The attacker deploys the Attacker contract with the address of the NounsAuctionHouseV2 contract.

2. Generate large range of IDs
The attacker provides a very large range (startId and endId) to overload the loop in the warmUpSettlementState function.

3. Invoke vulnerable function
The attacker calls the attack function, which invokes warmUpSettlementState on the target contract with the large range.

4. Gas exhaustion
The unbounded loop consumes all available gas, causing the transaction to fail and disrupting the contract's functionality for legitimate users.

### Impact

Denial of Service (DoS). Legitimate users may face disruptions in contract operations due to gas exhaustion during malicious or accidental calls to these functions with large inputs.
