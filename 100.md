# Lost of onlyDAO functions access due to the wrong DAO Executor address setting

### Summary

The `DAO Executor::setDAOExecutorAddress` function allows the DAO to change the address of the DAO Executor. However, this function itself is protected by the onlyDAO modifier. The `onlyDAO` modifier is defined as
`require(msg.sender == daoExecutor, "only dao");`. 
If the DAO Executor address is set to the zero address (0x) or a wrong address, it would prevent the DAO from updating the address again, effectively locking out access to the onlyDAO restricted functions.

### Root Cause

In [StreamEscrow.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L26) on line 26 the `onlyDAO` is defined as `msg.sender == daoExecutor`. 
In  [StreamEscrow.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L265) on line 265 the DAOExecutor can be set. The function is restricted by the `onlyDAO` modifier.

### Vulnerability

The vulnerability lies for the DAO Executor address to become inaccessible due to a misconfiguration.

```solidity
 modifier onlyDAO() {
@>        require(msg.sender == daoExecutor, 'only dao');
        _;
    }

@> function setDAOExecutorAddress(address newAddress) external onlyDAO {
        daoExecutor = newAddress;
        emit DAOExecutorAddressSet(newAddress);
    }
```

### Poc
The test below shows the case where the DAOExecutor is set the 0 address. Using an address that the DAO can't access (a 'wrong' address), can be proved the same scenario. 

Add this test in the DAOSettersTest contract in StreamEscrow.t.sol and run:

forge test --match-test  test_DAOCanSet0xExecutorAddress

```solidity
function test_DAOCanSet0xExecutorAddress() public {
        address zeroAddress = address(0);

        vm.prank(treasury);
        vm.expectEmit();
        emit IStreamEscrow.DAOExecutorAddressSet(zeroAddress);
        escrow.setDAOExecutorAddress(zeroAddress);

        assertEq(escrow.daoExecutor(), zeroAddress);

        // treasury can't call setter now
        vm.prank(treasury);
        vm.expectRevert("only dao");
        escrow.setDAOExecutorAddress(address(1));

        // zeroAddress needs to call it but the DAO can't be 0 address
        vm.prank(zeroAddress);
        escrow.setDAOExecutorAddress(address(2));
    }

### Impact

If the DAO Executor Address will be set to 0 address (0x) or a wrong address, the `onlyDAO` modifier will fail for all functions marked with this modifier. This includes critical functions like: `DAO Executo::setAllowedToCreateStream`, `DAO Executor::setETHRecipient`, `DAO Executor::setNounsRecipient`, and `DAO Executor::rescueToken`.

The DAO Executor would lose access to these important functions and would no longer be able to manage permissions, set recipients and rescue tokens. Leading to a scenario where many core functionalities would become inaccessible to the DAO Executor and the DAO cannot properly manage itself and assets.

### Mitigation

Implement a recovery mechanism that allow to set the DAO Executor address by the DAO Executor and one more trusted role.
