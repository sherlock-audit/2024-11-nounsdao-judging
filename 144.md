# Multiple people can have the same client id

### Summary

While creating a bid the user can specify the client id. The issue is that multiple users can specify the same non-zero client id. This could cause issues in the fronted when declaring the winners.

### Root Cause

There is no check to ensure that the clientId submitted is unique. If multiple people use the same non-zero client id it could cause issues in the frontend.
