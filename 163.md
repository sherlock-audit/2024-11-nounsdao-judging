# Malicious Bidder Can Trigger Denial of Service (DoS) Attack, Blocking Future Bids

### Summary

The lack of proper handling for fallback functions in _safeTransferETHWithFallback will cause a Denial of Service (DoS) for other bidders as a malicious bidder will use a contract with a fallback function that reverts, blocking refunds and preventing new bids.

### Root Cause

In this Line of code : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L365
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L181
In `_safeTransferETHWithFallback` at `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol:365`, the function does not account for the possibility that a user might send a bid using their wallet address contract that has a `fallback` function which always reverts transactions. This design oversight enables malicious actors to exploit refund logic in `createBid` function and create a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario.


### Internal pre-conditions

1-A user creates a bid using their smart wallet, which is a contract containing a `fallback` function designed to revert any received transactions.
2-Another user attempts to create a new bid. During this process, the refund mechanism in the `createBid` function will call `_safeTransferETHWithFallback` to refund the previous bidder.

### External pre-conditions

-A malicious actor deploys a contract containing:
- A function to interact with the auction contract and place a bid.
- A fallback function that reverts any transaction directed to it, ensuring the refund mechanism in the createBid function fails.

### Attack Path

# Malicious User Deploys a Smart Contract:
1-The attacker deploys a smart contract with two key components:
- A function to call createBid on the auction contract to place a bid.
- A fallback function that reverts any ETH transfer directed to the contract.
2- Attacker Places a Bid:
- The malicious user calls the createBid function on the auction contract via their smart contract.
```solidity
function createBid(uint256 nounId) external payable {
    auctionContract.createBid{value: msg.value}(nounId, clientId);
}
```
- The auction contract processes the bid, setting the attacker's contract address as `auctionStorage.bidder` and the bid amount as `auctionStorage.amount`
# Legitimate User Attempts to Place a New Bid:
- A legitimate user calls the `createBid` function to place a higher bid on the same auction.
- During this call, the auction contract attempts to refund the previous bidder (the attacker) using the `_safeTransferETHWithFallback` function:
```solidity
address payable lastBidder = _auction.bidder;
if (lastBidder != address(0)) {
    _safeTransferETHWithFallback(lastBidder, _auction.amount);
}
```s
# Refund Transaction Fails:
- The `_safeTransferETHWithFallback` function first attempts to send ETH directly to the attacker's contract using `_safeTransferETH`.
```solidity
function _safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 amount) internal returns (bool) {
    (bool success, ) = to.call{value: amount}("");
    return success;
}
```
- The call fails because the fallback function in the attacker’s contract reverts the transaction.
# Bid Reverts:
- Since the refund transaction fails, the `createBid` function reverts, preventing the new bid from being processed.
# Denial of Service:
- The malicious user remains the highest bidder indefinitely, as no other bids can be placed due to the inability to refund the attacker's contract.

### Impact

-The legitimate bidders cannot place higher bids due to the refund mechanism reverting transactions caused by the attacker's fallback function.

-The protocol suffers a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in the auction process, preventing fair competition and potentially allowing the attacker to win the auction at a lower bid amount.

-Legitimate users are unable to execute their bids, and the protocol risks losing credibility and revenue due to the unfair auction process.

### PoC

# Step 1: Attacker Deploys a Wallet Contract with a Reverting Fallback Function
- The attacker creates a smart wallet contract that contains a fallback function. This fallback function will revert any incoming ETH transfer, ensuring that the refund mechanism in the auction contract fails.
```solidity
// AttackersWallet.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract AttackersWallet {
    // Fallback function that reverts any incoming ETH transaction
    fallback() external payable {
        revert("Transaction Reverted");
    }

    // Function to send ETH to an address (used for bidding)
    function sendBid(address auctionAddress) public payable {
        (bool success, ) = auctionAddress.call{value: msg.value}(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("createBid(uint256,uint32)", 1, 1)
        );
        require(success, "Bid failed");
    }
}
```
# Step 2: The Attacker Calls the createBid Function
- The attacker will use their `AttackersWallet` contract to send a bid to the auction contract. Since the `AttackersWallet` contract has a fallback function that always reverts the transaction, this will cause the `_safeTransferETHWithFallback` function to fail when it tries to refund the previous bidder.
# Step 3: Auction Contract Fails to Refund the Previous Bidder
- Due to the revert in the attacker’s fallback function, the auction contract will fail to refund the previous bidder, resulting in a DoS attack where the auction is stuck, and legitimate users cannot place new bids.

### Mitigation

# Implementing a Withdraw Mechanism
-One effective mitigation strategy would be to replace the refund logic from the _safeTransferETHWithFallback function with a withdraw mechanism. This allows the previous bidder to manually withdraw their funds instead of relying on an automatic refund that could be blocked by the attacker’s malicious contract.

-How the Withdraw Mechanism Works:
- After the auction bid is placed, the contract should record the bidder’s refund amount and mark it as "pending withdrawal."
- Instead of sending the funds immediately (which could fail due to a revert in the fallback function), the contract allows the previous bidder to withdraw their funds at their convenience.
