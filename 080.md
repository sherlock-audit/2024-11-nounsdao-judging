# A malicious attacker can use frontrunning to disrupt a specific bidder's bid, causing negative impacts to the system.

### Summary

A malicious attacker can use frontrunning to disrupt a specific bidder's bid, causing negative impacts to the system.

### Vulnerability Detail
When a bidder attempts to bid on an auction, the attacker can easily find out the contents of his bid from the mempool.

The attacker can then frontrun the same transaction by paying a high gas fee with this data.
The bidder's bid fails and he tries to bid again with a higher bid price.
The attacker can frontrun even at the end of the auction, which will ultimately result in him becoming the winner of the auction and the bidders being unable to win the auction.

### Impact
1. No one can win the auction due to the attacker's frontrunning attack.
2. Ultimately this means the reserve price for the auction is not respected which would make bidders distrust the system. Bidders that donâ€™t realize this impact stand to pay a much higher price than anticipated, hence the HIGH risk rating. Also the bid will keep failing.
3. After the auction ends, the attacker becomes the owner of the NFT, and the address corresponding to the auction's clientID and the address of the NFT owner may be different.
