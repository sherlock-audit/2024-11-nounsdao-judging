# Auction Time Vulnerability When Contract Is Paused

## Summary
When the auction contract is paused, the auction’s end time continues to elapse without accounting for the paused state. This leads to a shortened bidding period once the contract is unpaused. As a result, users may not have a full bidding window to participate, reducing potential revenue and leading to an unfair auction process.

## Root Cause
The contract’s `endTime` is not adjusted when the contract is paused. The `createBid` function checks the `endTime`, but it does not consider the time elapsed during the paused state. Thus, auctions may expire before the contract is unpaused, preventing bids from being placed.

## Reference
- [Contract code: `createBid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L145)
- [Contract code: `pause`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L206)
- [Contract code: `unoause`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L215)
  
## Proof of Concept
- **Problem:** When the auction is ongoing, but the contract is paused, the `endTime` keeps ticking down. Once the contract is unpaused, the auction might have already expired, preventing any further bids.
- **Affected Code:**
  - The check in `createBid`:
    ```solidity
    require(block.timestamp < _auction.endTime, 'Auction expired');
    ```
  - The `pause` and `unpause` functions:
    ```solidity
    function pause() external onlyOwner { _pause(); }
    function unpause() external onlyOwner { _unpause(); }
    ```
  - These functions do not adjust `endTime`, causing the issue.

## Internal Pre-conditions
- The contract is paused, and the auction is ongoing.
- Users attempt to place bids while the contract is paused.

## External Pre-conditions
- A user may attempt to place a bid after the pause has ended but before the auction's natural expiration.

## Attack Path
1. User attempts to place a bid during an auction, but the contract is paused.
2. The auction continues counting down while paused, eventually expiring before the contract is unpaused.
3. Once the contract is unpaused, the auction is technically over, and the user cannot place a bid.

## Impact
- Users lose out on the opportunity to participate in the auction, which can result in reduced protocol revenue.
- The auction timing becomes unreliable, leading to an unfair bidding process.
