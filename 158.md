# It is possible to deny DAO of all the auction proceeds revenue besides the `immediateTreasuryBPs` share

### Summary

Whenever `immediateTreasuryBPs` be set too low it will be possible to deny all the DAO revenues while spending the `immediateTreasuryBPs` of it, by winning all the auctions and immediately cancelling the corresponding streams

### Root Cause

When `immediateTreasuryBPs` is set too low the following griefing vector gains viability: in order to deprive DAO of revenue win every auction and cancel the stream immediately.

There are neither boundaries for `immediateTreasuryBPs`, besides `[0, 10_000]`, nor stream remainder payout delay:

[StreamEscrow.sol#L167-L182](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/794903316961911a90ab5493ca66592ccbdbd036/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L167-L182)

```solidity
    function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
>>      require(isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream not active');

        // transfer noun to treasury
        nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);

        // cancel stream
        streams[nounId].canceled = true;
        Stream memory stream = streams[nounId];
        ethStreamedPerTick -= stream.ethPerTick;
        ethStreamEndingAtTick[stream.lastTick] -= stream.ethPerTick;

        // calculate how much needs to be refunded
        uint256 ticksLeft = stream.lastTick - currentTick;
        uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;
>>      (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amountToRefund }('');
```

There will be no second auction for the day and the `1 - immediateTreasuryBPs` share will be returned to the attacker right away, so they can repeat the next day with roughly the same capital given `immediateTreasuryBPs` is small enough. Such immediate way of removing the auction revenue from DAO was not present before the streaming

### Internal pre-conditions

`immediateTreasuryBPs` is set low enough, e.g. below `5%`

### External pre-conditions

Attacker owns the funds to win one daily auction and willing to spend `immediateTreasuryBPs` share of this amount daily in order to deprive DAO from all the remaining new auction revenue.

E.g. the attacker needs a maximum of winning auction bids for some proceeding period with some additional buffer for bull market case (say `10 + 2 = 12 ETH` if `10 ETH` was the highest winning bid for a period) and with additional `immediateTreasuryBPs` share suck costs multiplied by the length of the attack in days (say for `5%` it can be `5% * 100 days = 500%`, so the attacker needs roughly `600% * 12 ETH = 72 ETH`, which is a high enough, but overall achievable pre-condition

### Attack Path

Winning all the auctions and immediately cancelling the corresponding streams

### Impact

DAO will lose `1 - immediateTreasuryBPs` share of its whole new auctions revenue stream until `immediateTreasuryBPs` be increased or attacker exhaust their funds

### PoC

1. `createBid()` until the auction is won
2. `cancelStream(idWon)`
3. Repeat daily until attack allocated funds be fully spent

### Mitigation

Consider introducing the hard coded minimum for the `immediateTreasuryBPs` parameter. Also a payment delay can be introduced, where the stream is cancelled immediately per owner request, but the funds are being sent to them over a course of few days via an another call
