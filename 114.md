# The protocol will experience stalled ETH streams due to timestamp initialization issue

### Summary

The missing initialization check in `forwardAll` function will cause a complete halt of ETH stream progression for the protocol as the function fails to progress streams


### Root Cause

In [StreamEscrow.sol:136-149](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L136-L149), there is a critical initialization issue with the `lastForwardTimestamp` variable. 

When `forwardAll` function is first called , the condition block.timestamp < `lastForwardTimestamp` + `minimumTickDuration` evaluates to true because `lastForwardTimestamp` is initialized to 0. This causes the function to return early without updating `lastForwardTimestamp`.


```solidity 
if (block.timestamp < lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration) {  
    return;  
} 
```


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract needs to be in its initial deployment state with `lastForwardTimestamp` set to 0
2. `minimumTickDuration` needs to be set to a non-zero value
3. Sufficient time needs to have passed since contract deployment

### External pre-conditions

1. Block timestamp must be greater than contract deployment timestamp

### Attack Path

1. The `forwardAll` function is called
2. There is a check on the `block.timestamp` < `lastForwardTimestamp` + `minimumTickDuration`
3. This condition prevents the function from updating streams or `lastForwardTimestamp`
4. ETH streams remain stationary and do not progress

### Impact

The protocol suffers a complete disruption of ETH stream progression. The contract cannot forward streams, potentially causing financial processing delays and breaking expected contract functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `forwardAll` function to explicitly handle the first-time initialization:

```solidity 

function forwardAll() public {
    if (lastForwardTimestamp == 0) {
        lastForwardTimestamp = toUint48(block.timestamp);
        emit StreamsForwarded(currentTick, 0, ethStreamedPerTick, lastForwardTimestamp);
        return;
    }
    // Existing forwarding logic
}
```
