# {A Malicious Bidder} will {Indefinitely Extend Auctions} {for Other Bidders}

### Summary

The unrestricted timeBuffer mechanism in the [createBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L119) function will cause auctions to be perpetually extended for other bidders as a malicious bidder will exploit the time buffer to continuously extend auctions, preventing legitimate participants from winning.

### Root Cause

The choice to implement an unbounded `timeBuffer` in the `createBid` function is flawed. This design allows auctions to be extended indefinitely by permitting bidders to place bids within the `timeBuffer` period without imposing any limits on the number of extensions.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An auction is currently active with a defined `endTime`.
2. A malicious bidder can place bids repeatedly within the `timeBuffer` period to extend the auction's duration.
3. Each new bid meets or exceeds the `minBidIncrementPercentage` requirement over the previous bid.
4. The contract does not impose a maximum number of allowed extensions per auction.

### External pre-conditions

The attacker has access to automated bots capable of monitoring auction end times and placing bids precisely within the `timeBuffer`. The contract owner has not set any restrictions or limits on auction extensions.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker deploys a Malicious Bidder Bot.
2. The attacker deploys the MaliciousBidderBot contract, targeting the NounsAuctionHouseV2 or NounsAuctionHouseV3 contract.
3. The bot places an initial bid that meets or exceeds the `reservePrice` and `minBidIncrementPercentage`, becoming the highest bidder.
4. The bot continuously monitors the auction's `endTime`.
5. As the auction approaches its `endTime` (within the `timeBuffer` period), the bot places another bid, triggering the extension of the auction's `endTime` by `timeBuffer`.
6. The bot continues to place bids within the `timeBuffer` period, perpetually extending the auction and preventing it from settling.

### Impact

Legitimate bidders are unable to win auctions, leading to loss of participation and potential financial losses. The auction cadence is disrupted, potentially leading to delays in asset distribution and complications in system state management.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Introduce a maximum number of allowed extensions per auction (e.g., a maximum of 5 extensions).
2. Enforce a cooldown period after each extension to prevent back-to-back last-second bids
