# ` NounsAuctionHouseV3` is wrongly deployed

### Summary









##  Description  +  Impact






` .s.sol files are scripts we are going to use as part of the deployment and upgrade on mainnet, so they are in scope in case there are any issues there ` was sent in the discord channel by one of the sponsors so these vulnerabilities are in scope. Will be marked as medium only because of the sponsor's statement even if it can very easily be mitigated.






https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/script/StreamEscrow/DeployAuctionHouseV3StreamEscrowBase.s.sol#L12-L41

 ` DeployAuctionHouseV3StreamEscrowBase.s.sol :: runInternal() ` is used to deploy the new version of the protocol that supports the ` StreamEscrow ` functionalities.


The issue is that the smart contract ` NounsAuctionHouseV3 ` is deployed as a normal smart contract and ` NOT ` as an upgradeable smart contract like ` NounsAuctionHouseV2 ` is.


The easiest way to solve the problem is to look at ` nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/test/foundry/helpers/DeployUtils.sol :: _deployAuctionHouseAndToken() ` and to copy the correct way of deploying ` NounsAuctionHouseV3 ` as an upgradeable smart contract that will execute  ` NounsAuctionHouseV3 :: initialize() ` too and all the other functions that will set the correct state of the protoocl in a atomically way.
