# Wrong argument used in deploying the ` StreamEscrow` smart contract

### Summary








##  Description  +  Impact






` .s.sol files are scripts we are going to use as part of the deployment and upgrade on mainnet, so they are in scope in case there are any issues there ` was sent in the discord channel by one of the sponsors so these vulnerabilities are in scope. Will be marked as medium only because of the sponsor's statement even if it can very easily be mitigated.






https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/script/StreamEscrow/DeployAuctionHouseV3StreamEscrowBase.s.sol#L12-L41









` DeployAuctionHouseV3StreamEscrowBase.s.sol :: runInternal() ` is used to deploy the new version of the protocol that supports the ` StreamEscrow ` functionalities.


` NounsAuctionHouseV3 ` is a fork of ` NounsAuctionHouseV2 ` that integrates the ` StreamEscrow ` functionalities.


` StreamEscrow ` smart contract wrongly is deployed with ` streamCreator_ ` argument as the already deployed ` NounsAuctionHouseV2 ` instead of ` NounsAuctionHouseV3 ` that is meant to be used in combination  with ` StreamEscrow ` smart contract.



`streamCreator_` argument is used in the `allowedToCreateStream` state variable. `StreamEscrow :: createStream()` uses `allowedToCreateStream` state variable as access control.  ` NounsAuctionHouseV3 ` is the obvious address to be set as `true` in `allowedToCreateStream`, even if it can easily mitigated by executing `StreamEscrow :: setAllowedToCreateStream()` after deployment.
