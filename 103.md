# Potential Unauthorized Stream Cancellation

## Summary
The ``cancelStream`` function in the ``StreamEscrow`` contract has inconsistent access control compared to what the documentation states. While the documentation claims that only the Noun owner should be able to call this function, the actual implementation allows any address to cancel active streams.

## Vulnerability Details
```javascript
   /**
     * @notice Cancels a stream for a specific Noun token. Transfers the Noun to `nounRecipient`
     *  and refunds the remaining ETH back to the caller.
     * @notice The caller must be the Noun owner. <= @audit
     * @param nounId The ID of the Noun token to cancel the stream for.
     */
```
The function only checks if the stream is active, but does not verify that the caller is the Noun owner.
```javascript
 function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
        require(isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream not active');

        // transfer noun to treasury
        nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);
```
## Impact
Any address can cancel streams for any Noun token, potentially leading to unauthorized cancellation of streams.

## Tool Used
Manual Review
## Mitigation
To align with the documentation and ensure proper access control, the ``cancelStream`` function should have this:
```javascript
function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
    // Ensure the caller is the owner of the Noun
   require(nounsToken.ownerOf(nounId) == msg.sender, 'not noun owner');
```
