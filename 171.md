# Previous bidder will not get a refund in some cases

### Summary

`NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::createBid` uses `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::_safeTransferETHWithFallback` to refund the previous bidder , which may still fail , hence making previous bidders unable to get their refunds

### Root Cause

The choice to refund previous bidders by first transferring eth , and if that fails , transferring it as weth is a mistake , as the weth transfer can also fail( and that too silently) as the users may have a malicious or missing `fallback` or `receive` function
`createBid` : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L145
`_safeTransferETHWithFallback` : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L365

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user needs to bid in an auction
2. They need to have a malicious or missing fallback and receive function

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user needs to bid in an auction
2. They need to have a malicious or missing fallback and receive function
3. Another user needs to bid in the same auction , by calling the `createBid` function
4. This function internally calls `_safeTransferETHWithFallback` , which would fail for the previous bidder

### Impact

The previous bidder loses out on their initial bid

### PoC

In this PoC , I have simply made the  `fallback` and `receive` function to revert , but keep in mind the previous bidder may have these functions wrongly implemented and/or missing also. The point is it is extra work and caution on the user's side to correctly implement their `fallback` and `receive` functions , which won't always be the case and this is where their refund will fail

In the `NounsAuctionHouseV3.t.sol` :
1. Add the following contract

```solidity
    contract MaliciousUser {
    fallback() external payable{
        revert();
    }
    receive() external payable{
        revert();
    }
}
```

2. Paste the following function in `NounsAuctionHouseV3Test`

```solidity
    function test_createBid_breaks() public {
        uint256 nounId = auction.auction().nounId;
        MaliciousUser malUser = new MaliciousUser();
        // address bidder1 = address(0x4444);
        address bidder2 = address(0x5555);

        vm.deal(address(malUser), 1.1 ether);
        vm.prank(address(malUser));
        auction.createBid{ value: 1.1 ether }(nounId);

        assertEq(address(malUser).balance, 0);

        vm.deal(bidder2, 2.2 ether);
        vm.prank(bidder2);
        auction.createBid{ value: 2.2 ether }(nounId);

        assertEq(address(malUser).balance, 0); // didnt get the refund
        assertEq(bidder2.balance, 0); // WAS successfully able to bid
    }
```

### Mitigation

Use pull over push mechanism , i.e. , dont refund the previous bidder right away in the same function , instead store the balances(refunds) using a mapping , and create a withdraw function , where people can withdraw their funds if they are eligible for it.
