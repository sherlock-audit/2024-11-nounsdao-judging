# Missing Validation for streamLengthInTicks in createStream Function

### Summary

The lack of validation for streamLengthInTicks in the createStream function can cause a division-by-zero error or an ineffective stream configuration. This can lead to transaction reverts or the creation of streams with no meaningful effect for users if improper inputs are provided.

### Root Cause

In the StreamEscrow.sol

In the [createStream function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L112)
uint128 ethPerTick = toUint128(msg.value / streamLengthInTicks);
Missing Validation: The function does not check if streamLengthInTicks is greater than zero or if msg.value is sufficient to divide evenly across streamLengthInTicks.

### Internal pre-conditions

Internal Pre-Conditions
The allowedToCreateStream[msg.sender] mapping must allow the caller.
The msg.sender must be approved or the owner of the nounId NFT.
The nounId must not have an active stream (isStreamActive(nounId)).

### External pre-conditions

The streamLengthInTicks input is set to zero or a value greater than msg.value in the transaction.
No prior validation is done by the caller or any external protocol interacting with this contract.

### Attack Path

A trusted address calls the createStream function with:
streamLengthInTicks = 0: This causes a division-by-zero error, resulting in a transaction revert.
streamLengthInTicks > msg.value: This causes ethPerTick to be zero, rendering the stream ineffective and sending the remainder of msg.value directly to the DAO.
The stream is either not created or becomes non-functional, undermining its intended purpose.

### Impact

For streamLengthInTicks = 0:
Users experience transaction reverts, wasting gas fees.
For streamLengthInTicks > msg.value:
The stream is created but ineffective (ethPerTick = 0), preventing any meaningful streaming of ETH.
The remaining funds are lump-summed to the DAO, bypassing the stream mechanism.

### PoC

// Example test for a zero or insufficient streamLengthInTicks
function testCreateStreamFailsOnInvalidStreamLengthInTicks() public {
    uint256 invalidStreamLength = 0; // Or set it greater than msg.value
    uint256 msgValue = 1 ether;
    uint256 nounId = 1;

    // Expect revert on invalid streamLengthInTicks
    vm.expectRevert("streamLengthInTicks must be greater than zero");
    streamEscrow.createStream{value: msgValue}(nounId, invalidStreamLength);
}

### Mitigation

Add Validation for streamLengthInTicks in createStream:
require(streamLengthInTicks > 0, "streamLengthInTicks must be greater than zero");
require(msg.value >= streamLengthInTicks, "msg.value must be >= streamLengthInTicks");
Ensure Defense-in-Depth:
Validate streamLengthInTicks during the parameter-setting phase (setStreamEscrowParams).
Double-check the value within the createStream function for robustness.
