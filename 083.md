# `streamLengthInTicks` is set to the wrong value

### Summary

Inside the provided [docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gxLSkRQooJtcqMm3I86cOJpsnaObwEE5ergqkSl87kM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gyd74m96vtqo) it's well described how the ticks at which the stream should be distributed are 1460

> b. streamLengthInTicks = 1460, i.e. roughly 4 years.

and 

> Noun owners may also fast-forward their stream if they wish to fund the DAO faster than the default stream setting of 4 years linearly.

However inside the actual upgrade code it's 1500 ticks. This might look like a minor change, however it should be noted that each tick is 24 hours, meaning the real spread is not over 4 years, but 4 years and 1.5 months.

```solidity
        targets[1] = AUCTION_HOUSE_PROXY_SEPOLIA;
        signatures[1] = 'setStreamEscrowParams(address,uint16,uint16)';

### Root Cause

Wrong set up of contracts

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The spread will be more than the one provided inside the docs, causing the funds to be distributed over a much longer period of time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider changing it to 1460 in order to match the docs and to distribute the funds over those 4 years, as `365 * 4 = 1460`.
