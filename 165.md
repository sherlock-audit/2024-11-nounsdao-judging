# Attacker will control auction mechanism through proxy reinitialization for all Nouns bidders

### Summary

The missing _disableInitializers() in implementation contracts will cause a complete manipulation of auction parameters for all Nouns participants as attackers will frontrun proxy upgrades to reinitialize storage with malicious values

### Root Cause

In NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L72-L76 and NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L82-L86 there is a missing _disableInitializers() call in the constructor which allows the implementation contract to be reinitialized after upgrade

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `upgrade()` to deploy new implementation contract
2. Attacker calls `initialize()` with malicious parameters:
   - Low `reservePrice`
   - High `timeBuffer` 
   - High `minBidIncrementPercentage`
   - Malicious `streamEscrow` address
3. Admin's initialization fails as attacker already initialized contract

### Impact

## Impact
The protocol suffers from critical parameter manipulation due to unprotected initialization. The attacker can:

1. DoS auction participation by setting extreme bid requirements:
   - `minBidIncrementPercentage` = 255 (max uint8) forces 255% higher bids
   - Normal users cannot participate due to excessive bid requirements

2. Manipulate auction timing:
   - `timeBuffer` = 86400 (1 day) extends auction by full day on each bid
   - User funds get trapped in extended auctions
   - Unfair advantage for timing manipulation

3. Break protocol economics:
   - `reservePrice` = 0 allows free auction wins
   - `immediateTreasuryBPs` = 0 blocks treasury revenue
   - `streamLengthInTicks` = 1 minimizes streaming period
   - Protocol loses control over economic parameters

### PoC

    function test_InitializerAttack() public {
        console.log("Initial Reserve Price:", auctionHouse.reservePrice());
        console.log("Initial Time Buffer:", auctionHouse.timeBuffer());
        console.log("Initial Min Bid Increment:", auctionHouse.minBidIncrementPercentage());

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        auctionHouse.initialize(
            0, // reservePrice set to 0
            1 days, // timeBuffer set to maximum
            255 // minBidIncrementPercentage set to maximum
        );
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(auctionHouse.reservePrice(), 0, "Reserve price should be 0");
        assertEq(auctionHouse.timeBuffer(), 1 days, "Time buffer should be 1 day");
        assertEq(auctionHouse.minBidIncrementPercentage(), 255, "Min bid increment should be 255");

        console.log("After Attack Reserve Price:", auctionHouse.reservePrice());
        console.log("After Attack Time Buffer:", auctionHouse.timeBuffer());
        console.log("After Attack Min Bid Increment:", auctionHouse.minBidIncrementPercentage());
    }

### Mitigation

Add `_disableInitializers()` in the constructor to prevent re-initialization after deployment.
