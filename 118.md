# Every 10th token is auctionable due to an incorrect function implement and the absence of proper checks in `_createAuction`.

## Summary
Every 10th token, which should not be auctioned, can be put up for auction due to the absence of a proper check to prevent it.

## Vulnerability Details
The docs and `warmUpSettlementState` function state that every 10th token is a nounder reward nouns and should not be auctioned.

The `_createAuction` function in the `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol` contracts does not include any checks or functionality to prevent every 10th token from being auctioned.

```solidity
      function _createAuction() internal {
        try nouns.mint() returns (uint256 nounId) {
            uint40 startTime = uint40(block.timestamp);
            uint40 endTime = startTime + uint40(duration);

            auctionStorage = AuctionV2({
                nounId: uint96(nounId),
                clientId: 0,
                amount: 0,
                startTime: startTime,
                endTime: endTime,
                bidder: payable(0),
                settled: false
            });

            emit AuctionCreated(nounId, startTime, endTime);
        } catch Error(string memory) {
            _pause();
        }
    }
```



## Impact
Every 10th token will be put to auction and do not send as nounder reward .

## Recommendations
This can be remove by following means:-
1. check for, if (nounId % 10 == 0) then transfer it to nouner reward receiver and do not auction this token.

2. can also check if the slot is warmed up or not. But this is not fully reliable because what if the slot is warmed up by no one.
settlementState.slotWarmedUp = true , auction and if false then send the token which is every 10th token to nounder reward receiver.
