# The NounsAuctionHouseV3::createBid() does not check if a Noun is reserved for the Nounders and hence anybody can win the reserved noun token.

### Summary

According to the  [documentation](https://nouns.wtf/noun/1329), every 10th Noun is reserved for the Nounders for the first five years but there is no check in createBid() function to prevent anyone from creating a bid and winning these tokens. 



### Root Cause

In NounsAuctionHouseV2 and NounsAuctionHouseV3, the createBid() [functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L145C5-L160C11) are missing a check to prevent anyone from creating a bid for the reserved noun tokens. 

### Impact

The impact is that the Nounders will not get their reserved rewards. 

### PoC

Paste the code in the test file. 

```js
     function test_createBid_revertsGivenReservedNounId() public {
       // change the current nounId to be a multiple of 10
        uint128 nounId = auction.auction().nounId;
        
        vm.expectRevert("Reserved Noun");  
        auction.createBid(nounId);
    }
```

### Mitigation

```diff
     function createBid(uint256 nounId, uint32 clientId) public payable override {
        INounsAuctionHouseV2.AuctionV2 memory _auction = auctionStorage;

        (uint192 _reservePrice, uint56 _timeBuffer, uint8 _minBidIncrementPercentage) = (
            reservePrice,
            timeBuffer,
            minBidIncrementPercentage
        );
       

+        require(_auction.nounId % 10 != 0, "not authorized to mint this token");
        require(_auction.nounId == nounId, 'Noun not up for auction');     
        require(block.timestamp < _auction.endTime, 'Auction expired');        
        require(msg.value >= _reservePrice, 'Must send at least reservePrice');

        require(
            msg.value >= _auction.amount + ((_auction.amount * _minBidIncrementPercentage) / 100),
            'Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount'
        );
```
