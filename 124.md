# Unhandled Mint Errors Disrupt Aunction Creation Functionality

### Summary

The _createAuction function contains a try-catch block to handle errors during the nouns.mint() call. However, the catch Error(string memory) block only catches errors raised by the require statement. It does not account for other types of reverts, such as those caused by arithmetic overflows, out-of-gas errors, or custom Solidity errors. Consequently, if an unhandled error occurs:

The catch Error(string memory) block will be skipped.
The _pause() function will not be executed.
The contract will continue without correctly addressing the failure, leaving the auction state uninitialized or inconsistent.
This behavior means the contract will not pause when it is supposed to, leading to further operational failures and blocking essential contract functionality.

In case of an error at the `mint()` function the auction won't be settled till the owner intervenes and pauses the contract.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L315

The use of catch Error(string memory) limits the error-handling mechanism to a subset of possible errors, excluding custom or low-level errors. This causes the error-handling logic (such as pausing the contract) to be bypassed in scenarios where errors are not of the expected type.

Limited Scope of catch Error(string memory). This block only handles reverts caused by:

-require(condition, "reason").
-Explicit revert("reason").

It does not catch:

-Arithmetic panics (e.g., overflow/underflow).
-Custom errors (e.g., revert CustomError()).
-Low-level failures (e.g., out-of-gas or invalid opcodes).
When any of these unhandled errors occur during nouns.mint(), the catch Error(string memory) block will not execute, and the contract will skip error handling altogether, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state.

```solidity
  emit AuctionCreated(nounId, startTime, endTime);
        } catch Error(string memory) {
            _pause();
        }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The _createAuction function is called to initialize an auction.
2. The nouns.mint() function is configured to mint a new token and return its ID.
3. An error other than a require revert (e.g., custom error, out-of-gas error, arithmetic overflow) occurs in nouns.mint().

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Trigger an auction creation through _createAuction.
2. Induce a failure in nouns.mint() using a condition that raises an unhandled error (e.g., custom error or low-level revert).
3. Observe that the error is not caught, _pause() is not executed, and the auction state remains uninitialized.

### Impact

1. The auction state (auctionStorage) remains uninitialized or partially initialized, breaking core auction functionality.
2. Further actions, such as placing bids or settling auctions, will fail.
3. Denial of Service (DOS): The auction mechanism becomes effectively unusable until the issue is manually rectified by the owner.

This is a valid medium based on Sherlock rules which says "Could Denial-of-Service (DOS), griefing, or locking of contracts count as Medium (or High) severity issue? To judge the severity we use two separate criteria:

The issue causes funds to be locked for more than a week.

The issue impacts the availability of time-sensitive functions (cutoff functions are not considered time-sensitive).

If at least one of these is describing the case, the issue can be Medium"

Here is why;
This issue qualifies as Medium Severity for the following reasons:

1. It disrupts the availability of a time-sensitive function (auction creation): The auction creation process is a time-sensitive function as it is crucial for maintaining the flow of auctions. The inability to initialize a new auction disrupts the core functionality of the protocol, preventing users from participating in new auctions.
Since auctions typically involve sequential processes (create auction → place bids → settle), any break in the creation phase blocks the subsequent flow, effectively halting protocol operation.

2. It effectively breaks core contract functionality, rendering the protocol unusable for auction activities until intervention:
 If the nouns.mint() function fails due to an unhandled error (e.g., custom error or low-level revert), the contract does not pause as expected, leaving the auction in an inconsistent state. This blocks further actions related to auctions, effectively resulting in a DOS for auction-related functionality.
Impact Classification: This is not a "one-block DOS," as the issue persists until manually addressed by the contract owner.

3. While it does not directly result in significant or relevant loss of funds, the protocol's ability to generate revenue through auctions is impaired.

### PoC

Here's a test that proves that `catch Error()` doesn't catch custom errors (the test will fail):

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract ContractTest is Test {
    function testErr() public{
        Reverter r = new Reverter();
        try r.throwCustomError(){

        }catch Error(string memory) {

        }
    }
}

contract Reverter{
    error  MyErr();

    function throwCustomError() public{
        revert MyErr();
    }
}


```


### Mitigation

Remove the `Error` so that it'll catch any kind of revert:

```diff
             // Pause the contract if token minting failed
-        } catch Error(string memory) {
+        } catch  {
             _pause();
         }
     }
```
