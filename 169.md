# Possible greifing of auctions at no cost if `immediateTreasuryBPs` is 0

### Summary
The `immediateTreasuryBPs` represents the percentage of a winning bid that is transferred immediately to the treasury after an auction settlement. However, if this percentage is set to zero, it creates a vulnerability that allows an attacker to place an inflated bid, win the auction, then withdraw their ETH using `streamEscrow::cancelStream`. The attacker can then place another high bid in the subsequent auction, effectively preventing smaller investors from ever having a chance to win a Noun. This exploit could lead to repeated manipulation, with the attacker cycling through auctions without risking any of their own funds.

### Root Cause
The `NounsAuctionHouseV3::_settleAuction` function calculates the portion of the winning bid that is sent to the treasury immediately, based on the `immediateTreasuryBPs` value:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L332-L338
```solidity
        auctionStorage.settled = true;
        uint256 amountToSendTreasury = (_auction.amount * immediateTreasuryBPs) / 10_000;
        uint256 amountToStream = _auction.amount - amountToSendTreasury;

        if (amountToSendTreasury > 0) {
            _safeTransferETHWithFallback(owner(), amountToSendTreasury);
        }
```
and locks the rest of bid in the `streamEscrow`:
```solidity
        if (amountToStream > 0) {
            streamEscrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream{ value: amountToStream }(_auction.nounId, streamLengthInTicks);
```
If `immediateTreasuryBPs` is zero, the entire winning bid amount is locked in the `streamEscrow`, and the funds are not immediately sent to the treasury. After the new stream is created, the noun owner can cancel the stream and withdraw the ETH using `streamEscrow::cancelStream`:

### Internal pre-conditions

- `immediateTreasuryBPs` becomes zero after a DAO proposal

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1- A proposal is executed, setting `immediateTreasuryBPs` to zero.
2- An attacker exploits this by placing a high bid (e.g., 100 ETH) on the current auction.
3- The attacker wins the auction by calling `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction`, then immediately calls `streamEscrow::cancelStream` to withdraw the ETH.
4- The attacker waits for the next auction and repeats the process by placing the withdrawn ETH as the highest bid.
This cycle continues until someone else places a higher bid, in which case the attacker withdraws their funds and may continue the attack with an even higher bid.

### Impact

This vulnerability effectively prevents smaller investors from participating in auctions, creating a market where attackers can repeatedly place high bids without risking their own funds. This leads to an unfair auction process, where legitimate participants have little to no chance of winning a Noun, as the attacker controls the outcome of every auction.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Currently, this attack is not possible since `immediateTreasuryBPs` is zero. However, if future DAO proposals decrease this value, the attack becomes feasible with minimal cost. A potential mitigation would be to implement a minimum threshold for `immediateTreasuryBPs`.
