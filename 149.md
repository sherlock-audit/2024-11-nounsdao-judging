# Insecure `cancelStream` Function Allows Approver to Destroy `nounId` and Withdraw Refunds

### Summary

The `cancelStream` function in the `StreamEscrow` contract allows both the approver and the owner to cancel a stream. This could result in the user's `nouns` being reclaimed and the remaining refunds being returned to the caller.

### Root Cause

In `StreamEscrow.sol:167`, the `cancelStream` function should only be callable by the owner of the `nounId`, not the caller or approver. When the owner of the `nounId` grants permission to another party to operate on the `nounId` within the `StreamEscrow` contract, the `cancelStream` function becomes insecure. The approver could call `cancelStream`, destroy the `nounId`, and withdraw the remaining refunds. Additionally, in `StreamEscrow.sol:164`, the `@notice` for the `cancelStream` function indicates that it can only be called by the caller, meaning the function does not meet this specification.
