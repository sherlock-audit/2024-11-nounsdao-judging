# Highest Bidder has the power to outbid new bidders with lesser bid by frontrunning in both NounsAuctionHouseV3 and NounsAuctionHouseV2

### Summary

The missing constraint in `createBid()` allows highest bidder to bid again. If a new bidder tries to bid then it can be frontrun by bidding the `(new bid - ( new bid * minBidIncrementPercentage)) < amount < new bid`. Which is essentially lesser than the new bid. But enough for the transaction of a new Bidder the revert. 
By this the Highest bidder is able to retain its position by paying less instead of having to outbid the new bidder again. 

### Root Cause

In Both `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L157C7-L160C11` and `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L141C1-L144C11` there is a missing check of new higher bidder to not be equal to the `auctionStorage.bidder`. Which gives highest bidder an extra edge to retain its position.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The Chain should support frontrunning.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice bids 1 Ether in Auction
2. Bob wants to bid 2 Ether. Bob sends txn to the mempool.
3. Alice reads to mempool. Now, Alice can either let Bob's txn to go through. Which means Alice will later require to bid amount ( 2 + 2* 0.02). Which is > 2.04 Ether. Considering minBidIncrementPercentage = 2%.
4. Or Alice can frontrun Bob's txn and bid 1.97 Ether. Which lead to next min Bid to be 2.0094.
5. Now, Bob bid is 2 < 2.0094. Leads to Bob bid to revert.
6. Essentially Alice just outbid bob with just 1.97 Ether instead of 2.041. The difference increases drastically as the amounts gets bigger.

### Impact

The highest bidder has the unwanted advantage to retain its position by essentially paying less. Which is not intended by design of the protocol.

### PoC

Add the following test in `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/test/foundry/NounsAuctionHouseV3.t.sol`
```solidity
    function test_createBid_getsFrontrunAndHighestBidderPayingLessThanAnticipated() public {
        uint256 nounId = auction.auction().nounId;
        address bidder1 = address(0x4444);
        address bidder2 = address(0x5555);

        console.log("Bidder1 Bid 1.1 Ether");
        vm.deal(bidder1, 1.1 ether);
        vm.prank(bidder1);
        auction.createBid{ value: 1.1 ether }(nounId);

        console.log("Bidder2 is going to Bid 2.2 Ether");
        console.log("Bidder1 Bids 2.16 Ether which will cause Bidder2 txn to revert as 2.2 is < 2% increment in 2.16");
        vm.deal(bidder1, 2.16 ether);
        vm.prank(bidder1);
        auction.createBid{ value: 2.16 ether }(nounId);

        assertEq(bidder1.balance, 1.1 ether);

        console.log("Bidder2 txn reverts as 2.2 Ether doesn't satisfy minBidIncrementPercentage constraint");
        vm.deal(bidder2, 2.2 ether);
        vm.prank(bidder2);
        vm.expectRevert('Must send more than last bid by minBidIncrementPercentage amount');
        auction.createBid{ value: 2.2 ether }(nounId);

        assertEq(bidder1.balance, 1.1 ether);
        assertEq(bidder2.balance, 2.2 ether);
    }
```

## Output ##
```text
  Bidder1 Bid 1.1 Ether
  Bidder2 is going to Bid 2.2 Ether
  Bidder1 Bids 2.16 Ether which will cause Bidder2 txn to revert as 2.2 is < 2% increment in 2.16
  Bidder2 txn reverts as 2.2 Ether doesn't satisfy minBidIncrementPercentage constraint
 ```

### Mitigation

By adding `require(_auction.bidder != msg.sender, 'Highest bidder cannot outbid itself');` check we can present the same user to frontrun other bids.
