# **Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Gas Consumption in `warmUpSettlementState` IN THE `NounsAuctionHouseV2` AND `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol` CONTRACTS **

### **Summary:**  
The `warmUpSettlementState` function in `NounsAuctionHouseV2` AND `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol` can be exploited to create a Denial of Service (DoS) condition by consuming excessive gas. This occurs when a large range of IDs is passed as parameters, causing the function to iterate over a significant number of elements. This can result in the gas required to execute the transaction exceeding the block gas limit, rendering the function unusable.

---

### **Vulnerability Details:**

1. **Location:**  
   - File: `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol` AND `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol`
   - Line: [350](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L350)

2. **Description:**  
   - The `warmUpSettlementState` function contains a `for` loop iterating from `startId` to `endId`. When `endId - startId` is excessively large, the gas required exceeds the block gas limit (~30M gas on Ethereum Mainnet), causing the transaction to fail.  
   - This vulnerability can be exploited to disrupt the intended functionality of warming up settlement slots, potentially impacting auctions or related processes.

3. **Proof of Concept (PoC):**
   - copy and paste this in the `NounAuctionHouseV3.t.sol` A test was written to simulate a large range of settlement states being warmed up:
     ```solidity
     uint256 largeStartId = 0;
     uint256 largeEndId = 20000; // Large range to simulate DoS attempt
     uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();
     auction.warmUpSettlementState(largeStartId, largeEndId);
     uint256 gasAfter = gasleft();
     console.log("Gas used for large range:", gasBefore - gasAfter);
     ```
   - Gas used: **883,180,016**, far exceeding the block gas limit.

4. **Impact:**  
   - This vulnerability allows an attacker to disrupt the functionality of the `warmUpSettlementState` function by exploiting gas limitations, leading to a Denial of Service condition.

### **Recommendations:**  These are some of the recommendation to fix the vulnerability, Any or multiple of the following should be fine.
1. **Restrict Range Size:**  
   - Introduce a check to limit the range (`endId - startId`) to a safe value that ensures gas usage remains within block gas limits:
     
```diff
+      error maxGasLimitError();
+      // this can be flexible depending on the dev choise settings
+      uint256 MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 5000;

          function warmUpSettlementState(uint256 startId, uint256 endId) external {
+            require(endId - startId <= MAX_BATCH_SIZE, "Range too large");
        for (uint256 i = startId; i < endId; ++i) {
            // Skipping Nounder rewards, no need to warm up those slots since they are never used.
            // this keyword continue, is weird... 
            // o think this next line is protecting from a DOS attack
            if (i <= 1820 && i % 10 == 0) continue;
            

            SettlementState storage settlementState = settlementHistory[i];
            if (settlementState.blockTimestamp == 0) {
                settlementState.blockTimestamp = 1;
                settlementState.slotWarmedUp = true;
            }

        }
```

2. **Implement a more stricter Batching:**  

3. **Add Gas Safety Checks:**  
   - Monitor gas usage within the loop and break early if the remaining gas drops below a safe threshold:

```diff
+      error maxGasLimitError();
+      //this can be flexible depending on the dev choise settings
+      uint256 public constant SAFE_GAS_THRESHOLD = 20_000_000;

          function warmUpSettlementState(uint256 startId, uint256 endId) external {
        for (uint256 i = startId; i < endId; ++i) {
            // Skipping Nounder rewards, no need to warm up those slots since they are never used.
            // this keyword continue, is weird... 
            // o think this next line is protecting from a DOS attack
            if (i <= 1820 && i % 10 == 0) continue;
            

            SettlementState storage settlementState = settlementHistory[i];
            if (settlementState.blockTimestamp == 0) {
                settlementState.blockTimestamp = 1;
                settlementState.slotWarmedUp = true;
            }
+            if (gasleft() < SAFE_GAS_THRESHOLD) revert maxGasLimitError();
        }
```
