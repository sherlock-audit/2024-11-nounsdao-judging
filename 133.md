# Anyone can cancel multiple streams, causing various noun owners to loose their noun tokens to the treasury without their consent

### Summary

Anyone can call the function to cancel multiple streams corresponding to a list of nounIDs. Consequently, the owners of these noun tokens would loose their noun tokens to the treasury without their consent. 

### Root Cause

The `cancelStreams(uint256[] calldata nounIds)` in `StreamEscrow.sol` (at [L155](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L155)) doesn't have any access control.

Anyone can call this function with a list of `nounIds`, and the streams corresponding to all these noun IDs would get cancelled. 

```solidity
   /**
     * @notice Cancels multiple streams at once.
     * @param nounIds The IDs of the Noun tokens to cancel streams for.
     */
    function cancelStreams(uint256[] calldata nounIds) external {
        for (uint256 i; i < nounIds.length; ++i) {
            cancelStream(nounIds[i]);
        }
    }
```

### Mitigation

Ideally, going by the comment at [L164](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L164), only the owner of a noun ID should be able to cancel the stream for that noun ID. 

Since this constraint is not practical while implementing bulk cancellations, the access to executing the bulk cancellation should only be limited to trusted party within the team/organisation.

One way could be that this functionality should only be executed by the `daoExecutor`, ie restrict access control to this function using the `onlyDAO` modifier.
