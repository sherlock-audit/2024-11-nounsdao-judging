# Unintended Stream Interference Due to Shared Last Forward Timestamp

### Summary
The Stream Escrow contract, which facilitates streaming ETH in exchange for Nouns tokens, contains a potential vulnerability related to the shared use of the lastForwardTimestamp variable. This variable tracks the time when the streams are last forwarded, but it is a global variable that affects all streams.
If the attacker updates lastForwardTimestamp in period of minimumTickDuration, the user cannot calim.

```solidity
   if (block.timestamp < lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration) {
            return;
        }
```
By using that, the attacker extends the lastForwardTimestamp by calling forwardAll function in period of minimumTickDuration.
### Root Cause

The Stream Escrow contract, which facilitates streaming ETH in exchange for Nouns tokens, contains a potential vulnerability related to the shared use of the lastForwardTimestamp variable. This variable tracks the time when the streams are last forwarded, but it is a global variable that affects all streams.
### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

When a user tries to trigger a function  forwardAll(),
 the attacker can interfere by manipulating the lastForwardTimestamp (e.g., by triggering certain actions or calling functions that modify the timestamp) by front-running. As a result, the time condition (block.timestamp < lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration) fails, causing the system to block the user's request and preventing the auction or stream actions from being executed.
So after user performs settle auction, if the attacker calls once everyday, the user cannot claim.

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS), where legitimate users are prevented from interacting with the auction system. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove reliance on block.timestamp for time-based restrictions.
Introduce an alternative, more secure time tracking mechanism (such as block numbers or admin-controlled functions).
Add access control and cooldown mechanisms to prevent any user from locking others out by manipulating timestamps.
