# Incorrect Calculation of ethPerTick Fails to Account for Immediate Remainder sent to DAO Treasury

### Summary

In `createStream.sol`    the ethPerTick value is calculated based on the entire msg.value, without accounting for the remainder that is immediately sent to the DAO. This results in an inflated ethPerTick value, leading to inaccurate representation of the funds available for streaming over the duration of the stream.
