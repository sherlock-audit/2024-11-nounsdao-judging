# There are several issues regarding upgradability of NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol and NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol

### Summary

NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol and NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol contracts would have issues with their upgradability due to not inheriting from Initializable.sol contract for the Initializer modifier and using constructors to initialize Nouns token contract, the WETH contract address and the duration of a single auction, this would prevent them from being executed upon deployment.

### Root Cause

In NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol and NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol, the contracts do not inherit Initializable.sol which allows for the usage of the Initializer modifier used in the constructor and the Initialize() function. The contracts also initialize Nouns token contract, the WETH contract address and the duration of a single auction with the constructor in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L72-L76 and  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L82-L86.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The impact is that it causes issues when NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol and NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol is being initialized and prevents Nouns token contract, the WETH contract address and the duration of a single auction from being executed upon deployment.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. The contracts should import and inherit Initializable.sol
2. The state variable should be initialized with the Initialize() function.
3. The contracts should only import from contracts-upgradable, not from contracts.
