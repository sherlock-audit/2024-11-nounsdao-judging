# Insufficient Access Control for Auction Creation That allow anyone to create the next auction

### Summary
The settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction function in NounsAuctionHouseV2 and V3 lacks proper access control, allowing any external actor to create new auctions when the contract is not paused. This contradicts the protocol team's assumption that "only NounsAuctionHouse is authorized to create stream/auctions.”
[settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L102)
### Description
```solidity
function settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction() external override whenNotPaused {
    _settleAuction();
    _createAuction();
}
```
The function settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction can be called by any external address when the contract is not paused. This function:

- Settles the current auction
- Creates a new auction
- Only checks for the whenNotPaused modifier

The lack of access control contradicts the protocol's security assumptions and could lead to unauthorized auction creation.
### Impact
Unauthorized addresses can create new auctions
### Recommended Mitigation
Add proper access control using one of these approaches:

**Dedicated Role-Based Access:**
```solidity
address public auctionCreator;

modifier onlyAuctionCreator() {
    require(msg.sender == auctionCreator, "Not authorized to create auctions");
    _;
}

function settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction() external 
    override 
    whenNotPaused 
    onlyAuctionCreator 
{
    _settleAuction();
    _createAuction();
}
```
**OpenZeppelin's Role-Based Access Control:**
```solditiy
bytes32 public constant AUCTION_CREATOR_ROLE = keccak256("AUCTION_CREATOR_ROLE");

function settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction() external 
    override 
    whenNotPaused 
    onlyRole(AUCTION_CREATOR_ROLE) 
{
    _settleAuction();
    _createAuction();
}
```
