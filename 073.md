# Manual Execution Requirement in `forwardAll()` Leading to Delayed and Missed Funds Forwarding

### Summary

The function `forwardAll()` must be manually triggered to forward ETH to the treasury at regular intervals (based on `minimumTickDuration`). However, if the function is not called in a timely manner, it can cause a significant delay in forwarding funds.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L136-L149
 The logic in `forwardAll()`:
```solidity
 // silently fail if at least a day hasn't passed. this is in order not to revert auction house.
        if (block.timestamp < lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration) {
            return;
        }
```
ensures that the function can only be successfully called if a day or more has passed since lastForwardTimestamp. If `forwardAll()` is called late, it will only forward funds once, and the function will then require another full time interval to pass before it can be called again. This means any missed periods will not be automatically forwarded, causing a delay in treasury funds and missed tick intervals.

Ideally, the `NounsAuctionHouseV3::settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` calls an internal function `_settleAuction()` to conclude the auction, send the funds to the stream escrow and call the `forwardAllAndCreateStream()` which calls `forwardAll()` and starts a new stream, if there is a bid (bid amount to stream) else the `_settleAuction()` just calls `forwardAll()` on the stream escrow. if for some reason the `NounsAuctionHouse` is unable to settle the current auction which has lasted for more than a day, `forwardAll()` will have to be triggered manually which will cause delay and missed tick intervals.

### Impact

If `forwardAll()` is not called exactly on time, any missed funds will not be forwarded until the function is manually triggered. The forwarding mechanism depends entirely on someone/NounsAuctionHouse calling `forwardAll()`, and if there is any lapse in forwarding, the funds are delayed.

### PoC

copy and paste this in `CreateStreamPermissionsTest`

```solidity
  function test_ForwardAll_MissedTicksIgnored() public {
        vm.prank(streamCreator);
        escrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream{ value: 10e18 }(1, 1000);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 48 hours); // 2 day since the last forwardall called
        escrow.forwardAll(); // calling it will only forward once
        // reseting the lastForwardTimestamp, making us unable to forward the remaining
        assertEq(address(ethRecipient).balance, 1 * (10e18 / 1000));
    }
```
then run the test `forge test --mt test_ForwardAll_MissedTicksIgnored`

### Mitigation

Allow `forwardAll()` to accumulate missed intervals and forward funds accordingly. Calculate how many full `minimumTickDuration` periods have passed since `lastForwardTimestamp`, and iterate to forward ETH to treasury for each missed tick

```solidity
 function forwardAllMitigated() public {
        // silently fail if at least a day hasn't passed. this is in order not to revert auction house
        while (block.timestamp >= lastForwardTimestamp + minimumTickDuration) {
            lastForwardTimestamp += minimumTickDuration;
            sendETHToTreasury(ethStreamedPerTick);
            (uint32 newTick, uint128 ethPerTickEnded) = increaseTicksAndFinishStreams();
            emit StreamsForwarded(newTick, ethPerTickEnded, ethStreamedPerTick, lastForwardTimestamp);
        }
    }

```

POC to test the mitigation
```solidity
  function test_ForwardAll_MissedTicksIgnored_Mitigated() public {
        vm.prank(streamCreator);
        escrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream{ value: 10e18 }(1, 1000);
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 48 hours); // 2 day since the last forwardall called
        escrow.forwardAllMitigated(); // calling it will only forward twice
        //forwarding the correct number of ticks
        assertEq(address(ethRecipient).balance, 2 * (10e18 / 1000));
    }


```
copy and paste this in `CreateStreamPermissionsTest` then run the test `forge test --mt test_ForwardAll_MissedTicksIgnored_Mitigated`
