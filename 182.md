# using `transfer` will cause `rescueToken` to fail for some tokens

### Summary

the idea of the `rescueToken` function is to withdraw ERC20 tokens that may have been accidentally sent to the contract,when using transfer, if the return value of the transfer is not checked, it is possible that the transfer fails silently (returning a false ).

### Root Cause

tokens that do not return boolean will fail when called with `rescueToken`

### Attack Path

1. admin calls `rescueToken` to withdraw ERC20 that were accidentally sent to the contract, if these include some weird ERC20s, the function will not serve it's purpose, and the funds will be stuck permanently

```solidity 
    function rescueToken(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlyDAO {
        IERC20(token).transfer(to, amount);
    }
```


### Impact

some tokens will be stuck permanently in the contract

### Mitigation

use safeERC20 and `safeTransfer` for token transfers instead of `transfer`
