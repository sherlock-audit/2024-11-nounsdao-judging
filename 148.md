# SettleAuction may continue to revert if the onlyminter role is changed

### Summary

In the settleAuction function, if there were no bids, the token is supposed to be burnt. But this burning can only be done by the users with onlyMinter role in NounsToken.sol. In a similar scenario during creation of auction, the possibility that NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol not having the role is mitigated by pausing the contract, which is missing here.

### Root Cause

The missing try catch block in the settle auction function for burning, will cause it to revert. This scenario should have been properly handled by using the try catch block here also to pause the contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The onlyMinter role is changed in the NounsToken.sol without pausing this contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Not handling such a case will cause reverts and the auction cant be settled. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the similar try catch block present in the createAuction function in the settleAuction function too.
