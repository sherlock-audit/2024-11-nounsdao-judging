# cancelStream lacks Ownership check

## Summary
The ``StreamEscrow::cancelStream`` lacks access check which allows unauthorised addresses to cancel the stream abruptly without the intention of the owner.
## Vulnerability Details
``StreamEscrow::cancelStream`` cancels a stream for a specific Noun token and transfers the Noun to `nounRecipient`.
According to the Natspec,
```javascript
/**
* @notice Cancels a stream for a specific Noun token. Transfers the Noun to `nounRecipient`
     *  and refunds the remaining ETH back to the caller.
     * @notice The caller must be the Noun owner.
     * @param nounId The ID of the Noun token to cancel the stream for.
     */
```
It says the caller MUST be the Noun owner.
But in the ``cancelStream`` function, it lacks the owner check.
```javascript

function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
        require(isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream not active');
```
## Impact
The stream could be prematurely canceled for a legitimate user.
