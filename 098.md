# Permanent Locking of Excess ETH in NounsDAO StreamEscrow Contract that might have been sent by mistake.

**Severity**: Medium

**Vulnerability Context**

**Contract**: StreamEscrow

**Root Cause**: No callable function to rescue any amount of Excess ETH trapped in the contract.

**Impact**:

Excess ETH sent directly to the contract will be permanently locked with no mechanism for withdrawal.

**Proof of Concept**:

1. The contract does not implement a "rescueETH()" function as it does a "rescueToken" function, so we this implies it is expected that Tokens or the Native Token might be sent to the contract by accident.

See as rescueToken() is already implemented:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L292

2. Stream calculations are precise and do not account for excess ETH

3. The contract is non-upgradeable

4. No administrative function exists to withdraw accidentally sent ETH


**Historical Precedent**:

A similar vulnerability was identified in the NounsDAO Stream contract two years ago:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao-judging/issues/14](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao-judging/issues/14)

- The previous Stream contract also lacked a native token rescue mechanism
- This finding was confirmed and classified as a medium severity issue

**Technical Details**:

- Streams are calculated with exact ETH amounts per tick
- "sendETHToTreasury()" only sends calculated stream amounts
- No function allows withdrawal of unaccounted ETH balance
- Contract is non-upgradeable, making the issue permanently unfixable

**Potential Loss**:

Any ETH sent directly to the contract outside the stream mechanism will be irretrievably lost, potentially leading to permanent fund lockup.

**Recommendation**:

Implement a "rescueETH()" function similar to "rescueToken()", controlled by the DAO, to allow recovery of mistakenly sent funds.

```solidity
function rescueETH(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyDAO {
    (bool sent, ) = to.call{value: amount}("");
    require(sent, "ETH transfer failed");
}

```
**Risk Mitigation**:

- Add a function to rescue native tokens
- Ensure the function is protected by the "onlyDAO" modifier
- Implement proper transfer checks
