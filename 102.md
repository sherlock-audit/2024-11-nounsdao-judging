# Division by zero in createStream

### Summary

The `createStream` function in the `StreamEscrow` contract calculates the amount of ETH to be streamed per tick by dividing the `msg.value` by `streamLengthInTicks`. However, there is no validation to ensure that `streamLengthInTicks` is greater than zero, which could lead to a division by zero error.

### Root Cause

 Lack of input validation for the `streamLengthInTicks` parameter ([Line 118](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol?plain=1#L118))

### Mitigation

Add a require statement to ensure that `streamLengthInTicks` is greater than zero before performing the division.
```solidity
 require(streamLengthInTicks > 0, 'streamLengthInTicks must be greater than zero');
```
