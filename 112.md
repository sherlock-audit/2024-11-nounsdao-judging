# Majority can prevent Minority to quit ````StreamEscrow```` by setting ````nounsRecipient = address(0)````

### Summary

````StreamEscrow```` contract is designed for Minority protection, users can call ````StreamEscrow.cancelStream()```` to quit and get refund. The issue is that Majority can submit a proposal to set ````nounsRecipient = address(0)```` and prevent Minority to quit stream.

### Root Cause


The issue arises on ````L282```` of ````StreamEscrow.sol````([link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L282)), zero address could be set as ````nounsRecipient````. 
```solidity
File: contracts\StreamEscrow.sol
281:     function setNounsRecipient(address newAddress) external onlyDAO {
282:         nounsRecipient = newAddress; // @audit zero address could be set as nounsRecipient 
283:         emit NounsRecipientSet(newAddress);
284:     }
```
This would trigger revert on ````L171```` of ````cancelStream()```` function
```solidity
File: contracts\StreamEscrow.sol
167:     function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
168:         require(isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream not active');
169: 
170:         // transfer noun to treasury
171:         nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId); // @audit transfer to zero address would revert
...
186:     }

```
As ````NounsToken._transfer()```` doesn't allow zero address to receive NFT (````L379````)
```solidity
File: contracts\base\ERC721.sol
373:     function _transfer(
374:         address from,
375:         address to,
376:         uint256 tokenId
377:     ) internal virtual {
...
379:         require(to != address(0), 'ERC721: transfer to the zero address');
...
391:     }

```

### Internal pre-conditions

Majority of Nouns token is controlled by malicious parties

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

 Majority submit, vote and execute a proposal to set ````nounsRecipient = address(0)````

### Impact

Minority can not quit stream as design, the ````StreamEscrow````'s purpose of Minority protection get broken.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
File: contracts\StreamEscrow.sol
281:     function setNounsRecipient(address newAddress) external onlyDAO {
+            require(newAddress != address(0), 'zero address not allowed');
282:         nounsRecipient = newAddress;
283:         emit NounsRecipientSet(newAddress);
284:     }
```
