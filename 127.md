# Use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() for outgoing erc721 transfers

### Summary

It is recommended to use safeTransferFrom() instead of transferFrom() when transferring ERC721s out of the auction.

### Root Cause

[[OpenZeppelinâ€™s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-)] discourages the use of `transferFrom()`; use `safeTransferFrom()` whenever possible
The recipient could have logic in the `onERC721Received()` function, which is only triggered in the `safeTransferFrom()` function and not in `transferFrom()`

### Mitigation

```diff
         } else {
-            nouns.transferFrom(address(this), _auction.bidder, _auction.nounId);
+            nouns.safeTransferFrom(address(this), _auction.bidder, _auction.nounId);
         }
```
