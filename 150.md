# The Auctions cant continue forever

### Summary

In the docs it is mentioned that an auction will be held every 24 hours forever. But this is wrong, first of all it is not necessary that an auction will be held every 24 hours and second of all it cant be held forever. Due to the data types used, this number is around 36k years. Which is far from "forever" as mentioned in the docs.

### Root Cause

Here uint40 is used for block.timestamp which limits the auction to 36k years at the most.
