# Permanent Fund Locking in Auction Bidding Due to Incompatible Refund Mechanism

**Vulnerability Details**
 The auction contract's bid refund mechanism fails when a bidder's address (contract) cannot receive ETH or WETH, potentially trapping previous bid funds and disrupting auction functionality.

**Impact**
A malicious actor could create a contract that prevents bid refunds, effectively blocking future auction participation and locking user funds.

**Proof of Concept**
- Create a contract that cannot receive ETH or WETH
- Place a bid in the auction
- Subsequent higher bids will fail to refund the previous bid
- Auction becomes functionally blocked

**Recommended Mitigation**
- Implement a pull-based withdrawal pattern
- Add explicit checks for contract fund receiveability
