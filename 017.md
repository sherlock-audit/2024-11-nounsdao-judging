# lastForwardTimestamp not initialized

### Summary

lastForwardTimestamp is not initialized. When first call forwardAll() function, block.timestamp shouldn't be compared with lastForwardTimestamp, for it's zero. So the comparsion is between block.timestamp and minimumTickDuration. If block.timestamp < 0 + minimumTickDuration the function will return, and lastForwardTimestamp will be updated.
