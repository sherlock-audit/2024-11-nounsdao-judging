# Denail of service by not updating `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::auctionStorage` storage vairable after `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::settleAuction` function call, lead to prevent from creating new auction for nouns.

### Summary

`NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::auctionStorage` variable store auction information of noun for which auction created. when contract is pause and `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::settleAuction` external function get call to settle that auction it doesn't update `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::auctionStorage` variable and it still store settled nouns info which will lead to three big problem. prevent from creating new auction and auction getter function will return wrong data.


### Root Cause

1- when NounsAuctionHouseV3 is pause and `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::settleAuction` function get call the `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::auctionStorage` variable is not update or delete at the end of call, this mean auctionStorage still store information of noun that auction is end for it and get settled. the issue is that when `NounsAuctionHouseV3` contract is get unpause and `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` function get call for creating new auction it will revert becouse inside of `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` function when  `_settleAuction()` get call it will revert becouse it get the `auctionStorage` variable `INounsAuctionHouseV3.AuctionV2 memory _auction = auctionStorage` and check that the auction is not get settle `require(!_auction.settled, 'Auction has already been settled') since `. since it already settled during `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::settleAuction` function call and `auctionStorage` still has auction that is settled meam `_auction.settled` is true and `!_auction.settled` here will be false so require will always revert .this all happen becouse`NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::auctionStorage` is not updated during `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::settleAuction` function call and still store information of noun that auction is end for and settled, this will prevent from creating new auction and lead to DOS.

during settle function you can see that `auctionStorage` variable which is struct,  not reassign to default value at end just `auctionStorage.settled = true;`  get update and set to true.
now when the `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` function get call, inside that first it call `_settleAuction` and it has this check.
```solidity
function _settleAuction() internal {
        INounsAuctionHouseV3.AuctionV2 memory _auction = auctionStorage;

        require(_auction.startTime != 0, "Auction hasn't begun");
        require(!_auction.settled, 'Auction has already been settled');
        require(block.timestamp >= _auction.endTime, "Auction hasn't completed");
```
the second require will revert becouse auctioStorage have settled auction info since the settleAuction function call, where `auctionStorage.setteled == true` and this value inside the second require with ! will always be false and revert.

so the main problem happen below when the settleAuction get call it settle the current auction but not delete or assign the   the auctionStorage to default zero after auction get settled.
```solidity
function settleAuction() external override whenPaused {
        _settleAuction();
    }
```
2- Since `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::settleAuction` not update the `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::auctionStorage` variable the `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::auction()` function will return wrong data becouse the auctionStorage still store details of nouns that is winned and not in auction anymore.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1-when contract is pause call the settleAuction function to settle the current auction.
2-since the _settleAuction dosen't update the auctionStorage variable correctly.
3-after the NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol get unpause back.
4- now call the settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction function.
5-you face with revert and new auction will not be create.


### Impact

if auctionStorage is not update in  `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::settleAuction` function it will lead to  `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` function always revert and new auction will never gonna create for nouns, `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol::settleAuction` function will return wrong data.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

when the auction get settle assign the auctionStorage struct variable to default values, and inside the `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction()` when there is no auction before don't call `_sttleAuction()` function directly create new auction and call `_createAuction()`.

```solidity
    function settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction() external override whenNotPaused {
    ++    if(auctionStorage.noundId == 0){
    ++        _createAuction();
    ++    }
        _settleAuction();
        _createAuction();
    }

    
    function settleAuction() external override whenPaused {
        _settleAuction();
    ++  auctionStorage =  auctionStorage = AuctionV2({
                nounId: 0,
                clientId: 0,
                amount: 0,
                startTime: 0,
                endTime: 0,
                bidder: payable(0),
                settled: false
            });
    }
```
