# Anyone can cancel a stream, so the noun owner can loose their noun token to the treasury without their consent

### Summary

Only the owner of the noun should be able to cancel the stream using `cancelStream(uint256 nounId)`. However, necessary access control check is missing, so anyone can cancel a stream corresponding to a `nounId`. So a noun owner can loose their noun token to the treasury without their consent. 

### Root Cause

In `StreamEscrow.sol`, as per the comment on [L164](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/StreamEscrow.sol#L164), only the owner of a noun should be able to cancel the stream for that noun token

But the function `cancelStream(uint256 nounId)` can be called by anyone because it is `public` & there's no check for checking if `msg.sender` is the owner that `nounId`. 

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Cancels a stream for a specific Noun token. Transfers the Noun to `nounRecipient`
     *  and refunds the remaining ETH back to the caller.
     * @notice The caller must be the Noun owner.
     * @param nounId The ID of the Noun token to cancel the stream for.
     */
    function cancelStream(uint256 nounId) public {
        require(isStreamActive(nounId), 'stream not active');

        // transfer noun to treasury
        nounsToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, nounsRecipient, nounId);

        // cancel stream
        streams[nounId].canceled = true;
        Stream memory stream = streams[nounId];
        ethStreamedPerTick -= stream.ethPerTick;
        ethStreamEndingAtTick[stream.lastTick] -= stream.ethPerTick;

        // calculate how much needs to be refunded
        uint256 ticksLeft = stream.lastTick - currentTick;
        uint256 amountToRefund = stream.ethPerTick * ticksLeft;
        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amountToRefund }('');
        require(sent, 'failed to send eth');

        emit StreamCanceled(nounId, amountToRefund, ethStreamedPerTick);
    }
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

A noun owner could loose their noun token, because anyone can cancel the stream and the noun would be transferred to the treasury.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check if the `msg.sender` is the owner of the `nounId`, before executing the logic of function `cancelStream(uint256 nounId)`
