# Missing `disableinitializers()` in `NounsAuctionHouseV2` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3` constructors can lead to malicious takeover of the implementation contract

### Summary

An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy.  The concern arises due to the usage of a proxy upgradeable contract without calling `disableInitializers` in the constructor of the logic contract. The `NounsAuctionHouseV2` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3` contracts lack the `_disableInitializers()` function call in its constructor. This oversight introduces a severe risk, allowing the attackers to initialize the implementation contract itself and take control of critical state variables within the contract.

### Root Cause

In the [`NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol:76`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L76) is missing the `disableinitializers()`.
In the [`NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol:86`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L85) is missing the `disableinitializers()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The `NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol:76` and `NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol:86` contracts use OpenZeppelin's upgradeable base contracts (`PausableUpgradeable`, `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`, `OwnableUpgradeable`).
- The contracts implement its own constructor.

### External pre-conditions

- An attacker has access to deploy contracts using this vulnerable implementation.
- There aren't additional checks or restrictions on who can call the initialize function after deployment.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker identifies the vulnerable implementation contract (`NounsAuctionHouseV2` or `NounsAuctionHouseV3`).
2. Call the `initialize()` function directly on the implementation contract.
3. Manipulate initialization parameters to take control of critical state variables within the contract.

### Impact

The attackers can initialize the implementation contract itself and take the control of the implementation contract. 

### Mitigation

Call `disableInitializers`: Include a call to `disableInitializers` in the constructors of the logic contracts ([here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV2.sol#L76) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/main/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L85)) as recommended by OpenZeppelin [here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#Initializable-_disableInitializers--).
