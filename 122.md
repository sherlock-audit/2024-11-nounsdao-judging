# Owner not initializer in constructor in NounsAuctionV3

## Summary
Initializing the owner in `NounsAuctionV3::initialize()` creates a window for a frontrunner to initialize the contract using custom parameters or the same parameters under their ownership.

## Vulnerability Details
When the contract is deployed, a separate transaction is used to call [NounsAuctionV3::initialize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L93-L113). A separate transaction is used because this is not deployed through any factory contract.

```solidity
    constructor(INounsToken _nouns, address _weth, uint256 _duration) initializer {
        nouns = _nouns;
        weth = _weth;
        duration = _duration;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Initialize the auction house and base contracts,
     * populate configuration values, and pause the contract.
     * @dev This function can only be called once.
     */
    function initialize(
        uint192 _reservePrice,
        uint56 _timeBuffer,
        uint8 _minBidIncrementPercentage,
        uint16 _immediateTreasuryBPs,
        uint16 _streamLengthInTicks,
        address _streamEscrow
    ) external initializer {
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
        __Ownable_init();

        _pause();

        reservePrice = _reservePrice;
        timeBuffer = _timeBuffer;
        minBidIncrementPercentage = _minBidIncrementPercentage;
        immediateTreasuryBPs = _immediateTreasuryBPs;
        streamLengthInTicks = _streamLengthInTicks;
        streamEscrow = IStreamEscrow(_streamEscrow);
    }
```

Take the following scenario:

1. `NounsAuctionV3` deployer deploys the contract in transaction#1.
2. `NounsAuctionV3` deployer also sends out a transaction#2 calling `NounsAuctionV3::initialize` with his custom parameters.
3. A malicious frontrunner observes transaction#1, and copies transaction#2 parameters or makes their own changes to the parameters.
4. The malicious frontrunner is now the owner of `NounsAuctionsV3`, while the `NounsAuctionV3` deployer's transaction#2 fails.
5. The malicious frontrunner can now begin auctions by calling [NounsAuctionV3::unpause()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-nounsdao/blob/8b6fb94f103134e751cf016e5c3f4185be89bb49/nouns-monorepo/packages/nouns-contracts/contracts/NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol#L215-221).

## Recommendations
Move the `__Ownable_init()` call to the constructor, and mark `initialize()` as `onlyOwner`:

```solidity
    constructor(INounsToken _nouns, address _weth, uint256 _duration) initializer {
        __Ownable_init();

        nouns = _nouns;
        weth = _weth;
        duration = _duration;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Initialize the auction house and base contracts,
     * populate configuration values, and pause the contract.
     * @dev This function can only be called once.
     */
    function initialize(
        uint192 _reservePrice,
        uint56 _timeBuffer,
        uint8 _minBidIncrementPercentage,
        uint16 _immediateTreasuryBPs,
        uint16 _streamLengthInTicks,
        address _streamEscrow
    ) external initializer onlyOwner {
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();

        _pause();

        reservePrice = _reservePrice;
        timeBuffer = _timeBuffer;
        minBidIncrementPercentage = _minBidIncrementPercentage;
        immediateTreasuryBPs = _immediateTreasuryBPs;
        streamLengthInTicks = _streamLengthInTicks;
        streamEscrow = IStreamEscrow(_streamEscrow);
    }
```
