# Denial of Service Risk in createBid due to Missing Bid Cancellation Mechanism

### Summary

The `createBid` function in NounsAuctionHouseV3.sol allows users to place bids on an ongoing auction. However, if a bid fails to meet the specified requirements (e.g., reserve price or minimum increment), it cannot be canceled. This creates a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability where subsequent valid bids are blocked if the contract's state becomes stuck in an invalid state.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If a bid fails to match the auction parameters (e.g., reserve price, bid increment), the state does not progress. Future bids are effectively blocked, as users cannot reset or override the invalid state.

### PoC

1. Alice creates a bid
2. Alice bids is not selected as a winner
3. No way to retrieve her a bid 

### Mitigation

Add a cancel bid mechanism
