```solidity
address constant AUCTION_HOUSE_SEPOLIA = 0x949dBCcc3EE35f11014DB0E48f21900E245564Ad;
```
```solidity
auctionHouseProxy: INounsAuctionHouseV2(AUCTION_HOUSE_SEPOLIA)
```
AUCTION_HOUSE_SEPOLIA should be NounsAuctionHouseV2 not the NounsAuctionHouseV3

```solidity
function runInternal(
        INounsDAOLogic dao,
        INounsAuctionHouseV2 auctionHouseProxy,
        uint32 minimumTickDuration
    )
```
```solidity
auctionHouseV3 = new NounsAuctionHouseV3(
            auctionHouseProxy.nouns(),
            auctionHouseProxy.weth(),
            auctionHouseProxy.duration()
        );
```
auctionHouseProxy should be NounsAuctionHouseV2 but is NounsAuctionHouseV3, which causes the nouns, weth, duration to be different from what was expected.
